"No, the FDA won't require studies for all indications for biosimilars.  They will only require studies for the most sensitive indication, and that is to be determined.  For example, that could be skin psoriasis for TNF inhibitors.",
"Biosimilars are like when Japanese automobiles were first introduced to the US.  Yes, everybody still wanted to buy American cars.  But eventually many ended up buying Japanese.  And with the insurance that my patients have, it all comes down to price- they'll get the less expensive treatment.",
"If the FDA doesn't believe there is a safety signal with biosimilars, and approves them for RA, the patients will be fine.",
What I worry about with biosimilars is factory safety.  We're not making aspirin here.,
"""There is concern that the FDA will approve biosimilars in disease states where it has not been studied.  I believe they should be studied in each indication prior to approval.""",
"""I was approached by Boehringer Ingelheim to share my thoughts around biosimilars. As a clinician I feel that biosimilars need to pass a high bar for outcomes before I would feel comfortable switching.  This would also include requiring trials in each tumor type a biosimilar is seeking indication.""",
"The activity for biosimilars is heating up. In Norway, they are seeing price reduction of up to 39%. I will be publishing an upcoming paper on the current state of affairs with regard to biosimilars in Nature Reviews Rheumatol.",
"""Biosimilars are going to really shake up the market. We can't expect these companies to invest in large phase III trails. Smaller trials demonstrating PFS and ORR similar to that of branded agents along with similar safety and lower pricing will be a major challenge. Pfizer recognizes this and is making investments in this emerging market opportunity.""",
"If biosimilars offer cost savings to the patient, I'll use them.  That's what I constantly hear about, is whether or not my patients will be able to afford their medication.",
"If it's approved by the FDA, people will think it's ok.  And if insurers require biosimilars, well then docs don't want to fight that fight either.",
"I won't be comfortable with biosimilars until there is real-world data, with large numbers of patients in the trials or in use.  Not some small study from Korea.  And not just an FDA approval.",
"""We are doing some biosimilar trials.  Enrollment is challenge though.  Our patients after reading the trial consent often ask 'what is the benefit?' We are basically asking them to try an experimental drug that hopes to offer the same benefit as the standard in hopes of bringing a lower priced option to the market. This isn't a compelling reason for many patients. Asking them to enroll in a study where we hope to extend survival beyond the standard of care is a different conversation.""",
Biosimilars are inevitable.  I would use an approved biosimilar to Avastin irrespective of the indication it was approved in.  I think we have a responsibility to reduce the cost to the system whenever we can.,
"""If a biosimilar is approved by the FDA and priced 20-30% below Avastin, payers will opt for less expensive therapy and we'll have no choice in what we use.",
"If a biosimilar is cheaper and available in the US, and the biosimilar is equal to Rituxan, more than likely we will be forced to use it.",
"Biosimilars are not cure products, so they do not have to be so pure. If its 90% Rituxan, that might be ok. If it is only 20%, not so much. It will take a lot of scientific proof to prove that the biosimilar is the same as Rituxan and will work in the body the same way.",
Just because a biosimilar works similar to Rituxan in vitro does not mean it will behave the same in vivo.,
I would need head to head data that shows that a biosimilar is superior to Rituxan to switch to a biosimilar. I would hate not to use Rituxan.,
Remicade's biologic is not doing well in Europe.  GI guys are not using it.  Biosimilars are not as similar as you might think.,
I wrote a paper on Biosimilars that is going to be coming out in GynOnc in the next few months.,
A South Korean company partnering with an American company came in to talk about their biosimilar.  That was enough.  They have a lot to learn about the US market.,
"""Avastin is the standard of care and I don't think we need additional Avastin data to continue using it. Regarding the biosimilar, comparable safety is extremely important. While safety of an agent is usually similar across tumor types, efficacy is not. Because of this, I am not comfortable with extrapolating efficacy across tumor types.""",
"""It would be interesting to see what would happen if Genentech lowered the price of Avastin by 20% about a year before the biosimilar comes to market or even just before it is approved. How would the biosimilar gain market share and recover startup costs when Avastin has superior efficacy and safety data along with years of physician comfort using it? Genentech has had time to recover the costs of developing and marketing Avastin. Does it make sense for you guys to keep more of the market at a lower price or keep your price where it is and potentially lose most of the market. I'm sure there are a lot of scenarios being looked at. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.""",
"I’ll follow what the FDA says regarding biosimilars.  It's hard enough to get a biologic approved these days, let alone a biologic approved after biosimilars come to market.
With existing patients doing well, I think they'll stay on their current therapy.",
I personally don't think there will be safety issues with biosimilars.,
"You could say that current biologics are biosimilars of themselves comparing the current version to one from eight or ten years ago, as they themselves have probably changed slightly over the years.",
"If a patient had a really severe vasculitis, I would rather stay with Rituximab than mess around with a biosimilar.  There's no time to waste there.",
"Whatever data the FDA requires for approval, I'll be comfortable with.",
"Based on the Korean data with infliximab, I have no concerns with biosimilar safety or efficacy.",
"I'm too busy to fight insurance companies.  The only time I'd do this is if the patient had concerns with going on a biosimilar.  I'd fight based on the patient's feelings, but not on a scientific level.",
I am beginning a Humira biosimilar study .,
"From Biosimilar RRS and Avastin Advocacy - ""It depends on the level of evidence, safety, and cost. If a biosimilar cost substantially less and the relative efficacy and safety are close it will be hard to make a case against the biosimilar. If the data is weaker and extrapolated, there is a case to made for BV. Many agents work in one tumor type and not another. A drug can be approved with close margin for benefit. For example, a few weeks difference in OS can be the difference between a positive or negative trial.  Response rate for a biosimilar s a low bar and then to extrapolate that across BV indications would not be compelling data.""",
Using biosimilars makes me very uncomfortable.  I would never extrapolate mbc results to ebc usage,
"If an insurance plan covers the biological, they would be expected to also cover the biosimilar",
We think and hope it (the biosimilar) will reduce the costs of these medications.,
"There isn't anyone right now who stands out to me as an expert, but I look to Alvin Wells for information and can pick up the phone to call him whenever I need advise or information",
"""Let me give you a typical Saltz (Pizzolato was a fellow at MSKCC) answer. 'It doesn't matter what I think!' This is going to be decided the government based on potential cost savings. There will be a low bar of evidence and biosimilars will be forced on us. You wait though, patients are going to emerge that have unexpected side effects or higher incidence of serious side effects. This is going to go public and there is going to be a backlash against the rigor of the approval process. It is going to happen.""",
"In the metastatic setting I would need the same data from biosimilars I currently have from CLEOPATRA.  Although, I could see perhaps starting a patient on the brand names and after several years switch to the biosimilar to see if they are maintained.  A few of my Herceptin patients are out past 10 years .",
"In the curative setting, I want biosimilars to have comparative data to Perjeta's. Not necessarily a phase 3 .  Appropriate improved biomarkers would  also be data that they could use to increase confidence.",
"If biosimilars are priced less than the branded biologic, the only way I'd go back to the branded is if I saw something different once I started to use them.  But up front, the data looks so similar between both.",
"If the FDA approves the indication, I'm ok with that.  But I probably wouldn't use it in GPA if there was only clinical trial data in RA patients.",
"""I would feel comfortable continuing to use Avastin but I may not have a choice. The weaker the biosimilar evidence, the stronger my advocacy for Avastin. In S. America biosimilars are having problems. Agents are approved with modest data and are inexpensive. Over time, surprising and serious side effects are being reported and the governments are requiring manufacturers to provide additional data and even considering requests to demonstrate survival benefit.""",
"Look, the test tube data will be fine.  But there's going to be subtle differences in efficacy and safety that concern me.  If a biosimilar is 80-90% as effective as branded, well that's the difference between achieving DAS remission and not.  Or what about immunogenicity leading to lack of efficacy or safety issues like atypical infections?   Or what's the risk of PML going to be?  That won't be known for another five years after they hit the market.  I know those rates for branded biologics now.",
I am presenting to Pfizer in 2 weeks in Rome a clinical development plan for an Avastin Biosimilar at an Ad Board.,
We will be doing a large study in ovarian cancer with an Avastin biosimilar.  We don't have the endpoint chosen yet.  There will be large studies in all the indications.,
"There are 3 companies looking at Biosimilars....  Pfizer, Milan, and Sandoz",
"It is my understanding that many of these biosimilar trials are done outside of the US. I assume that is because they are trying to get these medicines to people who cannot access them like in the US. I have not really looked into this, but I do not see how the FDA is approving this process outside of the US and bring the drugs here as approved. It seems like it would be infringing on intellectual property.",
I don't really buy into biosimilars at all. I really do not know how they will compete. I mean all we really have to worry about with Rituxan is infusion reactions and Hepatitis B reactivation. Can they compare to that safety profile with better efficacy? It is a high bar to reach.,
"I think that they only reason people would use the biosimilar is because of cost considerations. If the price of Rituxan is somewhat comparable, no one will use a biosimilar.",
Sandoz approached USO about a multinational Phase 3 biosimilar study in Ovarian Cancer.,
I would like to see a front line Avastin versus Biosimilar study with just single agent.  It is active and would be very easy to compare.,
"If I have a patient that is receiving RTX for relapse or maintenance of remission in GPA/MPA, I would not want to use a biosimilar. If it's not broke, then don't fix it... why take the chance if something is working well given the severity of this disease.",
For biosimilars it is my understanding that indications would be extrapolated based on biologics.  I have used RTX and I am comfortable with the extrapolated data.,
The Remsimalar data looks good.  Right now there are no noticeable differences or concerns with safety.  I am still however cautious because it is confirmed that branded biologics have changed over the years.,
We really don't know what to expect with biosimilars at this point.  I'll tell you one thing though:  there will be differences in side effects.  Biosimilars are simply not the same as (the reference biologic),
"Hospital P&T committees are going ot make the decision on the use of biosimilars, but they are going to want to know what we as experts think.  They wont be comfortable making these decisions without our input.",
"Since with oral drugs the cost goes to the patient anyway, I would be more willing to accept an oral biosimilar than an IV drug. Patients need their deductibles so I don't care as much.",
"""If a biosimilar was studied in colon and it was identical and I mean IDENTICAL, I would be okay extrapolating to other tumors types. However, my comfort with this moves along with the differences in the data.""",
"""Not a big fan of biosimilars. There is a lot that can go wrong with the structure.  Biosimilars should be studied in each indication. Extrapolating across tumor types is very risky.""",
"I don't think its a good idea to rely on extrapolated data.  For instance, ramucirumab was effective in gastric cancer in RAINBOW.  Avastin was negative in AVAGAST.  But we don't think that if you substituted Avastin for ramucirumab in that trial (RAINBOW) it would have been a negative trial.  We believe they are the same agents.  But you wouldn't use one drug in a clinical setting where it doesn't have positive data in place of a drug that does have positive data.  We don't do that now, so why would we do that with a biosimilar?",
"""Unless the biosimilar demonstrates at least non-inferiority, I would feel more comfortable using Avastin.""",
"The obvious place where a biosimilar will be used in place of Rituxan is in the iNHL maintenance setting. If a patient is PET-negative after 6 cycles of BR, I would be ok with a biosimilar maintenance schedule.",
I think there will be a significant amount of pressure here at University of NE to use a biosimilar. This will be the new fad in iNHL treatment.,
"Are there really any biosimilars experts? I think everyone is looking at each other going ""Who is going to jump first?"". I think it will be the patient advocates who will jump on this.",
This is a hot-button topic because everyone will follow what happened to Neupogen. I am sure you company is paying close attention.,
"The fact that contracts with insurers dictate treatments is awful.  You can thank Amgen for that.  And then when biosimilars are here, it's going to be even worse.  And we won't even know about it, because there's a bill at the legislature right now that pharmacists could substitute biosimilars without telling us.",
"There will be 3 segments you will need to pay attention to when biosimilars are on the market. The older academic physicians will be comfortable with what they have been using and will be less likely to switch. The young physicians just coming out of fellowship will be much more likely to adopt this and run with it. The others in the middle, like myself, will likely wait to see what happens. We will not necessarily be early adopters unless forced by our institutions.",
Our site has been approached by many companies wanting us to do their biosimilar trials (I won't name any names). We even had someone from the University of Nebraska come talk to us about doing these trials and he was very convincing.,
Janssen MSLs put together a very impressive deck post-ACR.  I was very surprised by the biosimilar safety and efficacy.  I saw the biosimilar interchangable data when compared to the original drug and was surprised by how good the data looked.,
"I won't use biosimilars unless I have to, if insurance makes me.  There are too many questions about their safety.",
"""I would prefer to see at least a phase II trial with the biosimilar to support each indication. If an indication isn't supported by this level of evidence, I wouldn't feel as comfortable using a biosimilar.""",
You need to get your scientists to get hold of the Biosimilars and take them apart.  You need to do bioavailability studies.   You need to show it is not the same- it will give me something to push the Pharmacist back.,
"""PFS might be reasonable in a large phase II but we really need to look at safety. It won't be easy to make a biosimilar that works exactly like Avastin. Even is efficacy is close, there will be different adverse events.  Even when other companies try to make improved anti-VEGFs, they don't come out superior in efficacy and have different safety signals. Ramucirumab is an example.   The same is true for different anti-EFGRs.""",
The data for the biosimilars is solid.  Major concerns if there will be trials across all disease states.  Will the FDA mandate requirements for 1-2 disease states or in all?,
"""Biosimilars are something we need to be very careful with. They aren't like generics and are complicated therapies to replicate. It is hard to believe there aren't going to be a lot of problems determining equivalent safety and efficacy.""",
"We have been approached by many of the biosimilars companies asking us to do their trials but we have passed on all of them. They are such a snooze. I don't know how you talk to a patient about enrolling in one of these. You would have to say ""I want you to take this drug that we HOPE is as good as the standard."" No one wants to have that conversation.",
"For me, the big issue with biosimilars is lack of radiographic data.  After all, that's what hurt Xeljanz initially when it launched.",
"The issue with biosimilars will be co-pays for the patients.  Biosimilars won't have co-pay assistance or programs like you guys.  And even if they're less expensive, they'll still be expensive.  And if the patient doesn't get assistance with the co-pay, they won't be able to access them.",
"Regarding the approval process for lipodox, the FDA approved on questionable data.  A bioequivalence study was not done.  There are papers published that discuss this.",
"I attended a ""market research"" event where I presented.  There were medoncs and gynoncs there.  Brad Monk and Tom Herzog presented on doxil and lipodoxil.  Nobody knew the process for substituting doxil and lipodoxil.  I think that is something that could happen with Bevacizumab- pharmacies could make a decision- ""we could order bev but not know what is given""",
How is the FDA going to handle running trials for a non-inferiority study?  These have to be large studies.,
I am not comfortable extrapolating.  We want to see studies with Ovarian patients.  Bev is different in CRC and ovarian.,
The path to biosimilars is difficult to understand.  Can you claim something is analagous based on structural and animal models alone?,
"Unless the patient truly can't afford the drug, then I would explore the use of a biosimilar but without reimbursement challenges, I would not give.",
"With these drugs we need to be cautious because we are not ""curing"".  The last thing you want to do is compromise their QOL with a biosimilar that is not extensively studied.",
"A bigger issue is the arbitrary QOL (quality of life).  The cost of the drug will have to come into play here- if QOL data is not the same, the price will have to be less.",
You guys could really buy yourself some goodwill by reducing your price before a biosimilar hits the market.  It would show you care about patients and not just looking after your own interests,
"Bevacizumab alters blood flow to the tumor, and you can determine efficacy by MRI imaging of the tumor because you will see a decrease in the vasculature of the tumor.  Clinical trials involving biosimialrs might select this as an endpoint to demonstrate activity.",
"One way a clinician could tell that the biosimilar is active is by looking for hypertension.  If the that and other AEs occur, than you can be reasonably sure that there is similar activity",
I do not foresee us here at Brook Army Medical center even contemplating utilizing biosimilars for years after they are launched in the private sector.  The government will watch what post marketing data is collected prior to making biosimilars available to patients.,
I've never understood why companies aren't talking about reducing their drug costs to compete with generics or now biosimilars.  They will make it up in volume and keep the biosimilars out of contention.,
"When the biosimilars become available, the payers will just substitute them for Rituxan.  It will be just like Taxol.  Everybody calls it Taxol but it's actually the generic form that is used.",
"In Canada, the recently launched infliximab biosimilar approved 6-8 months ago, is not seeing success.  The biggest gap is in the pricing of the biosimilar.",
"If a physician prescribes a biosimilar, they is an uncertainty.  There is no guarantee that you will see the same efficacy and safety you would see with a biologic.  We do not know this because there is no outcome data.  This is concerning because we are not talking about Tylenol.  We are talking about a biologic.",
Patients may not understand the implications of biologics.  It will be important to provide patient education.  They will more than likely look at biologics and think of them in the same way they think of generics or another class.  Physicians are well aware that generics are not all created equally.,
Genentech has a vested interest in getting GA101 to work.  Rituximab is going generic in a few years so the so called biosimilars- its not like a regular generic pill that is easy to make.  These so called biosimilars of antibodies that you can read about in the NY Times is a big controversy about when they will become available.  So they're trying to come up with the next generation rituximab.,
"By 2016, Rituxan is estimated to provide 6.8 Billion to Genentech. Rituxan is not cheap. There are companies developing bio-similars. Reditux is available. I don't know if these will work as well as Vitamin R (Rituxan). Hopefully they will reduce the cost.",
"""I've attended some biosimilar advisory boards. They are asking us about level of evidence for outcomes.  They ask us if we are comfortable extrapolating outcomes in one tumor type to other tumor types and our confidence in PFS as an outcome compared to OS.  I tell them that a phase III trial with OS as the primary point in the indicated tumor type is the gold standard.  The further away you move from that standard, the less confidence I have.  They know our concern and working to increase our confidence.  Ultimately though, I suspect it will be what the FDA approves and what pharmacy does that determine what we use.""",
"I'm unsure about biosimilars, but I believe in Amgen.  I wouldn't use the one from the South Korean company though.",
