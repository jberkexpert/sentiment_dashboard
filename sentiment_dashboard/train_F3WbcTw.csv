"Autoimmune diseases tend to come in clusters. As for Gilenya â€“ if you feel good, donâ€™t think about it, it wonâ€™t change anything but waste your time and energy. Iâ€™m taking Tysabri and feel amazing, no symptoms (other than dodgy color vision, but Iâ€™ve had it since always, so, donâ€™t know) and I donâ€™t know if it will last a month, a year, a decade, ive just decided to enjoy the ride, no point in worrying.",gilenya,2,,,
"I can completely understand why youâ€™d want to try it. But, results reported in lectures donâ€™t always stand up to the scrutiny of peer-review during publication. There so much still to do before this is convincing. I hope that it does work out, I really do. And if youâ€™re aware of and happy with the risks, then thatâ€™s great. I just think itâ€™s important to present this in a balanced way, and to understand why we donâ€™t move straight from the first show of promise in an animal study to using drugs on humans. Thereâ€™s still a lot of animal data to gather, and human data to gather before anyone can tell if itâ€™s safe or effective. I canâ€™t tell you how many times animal studies donâ€™t follow through to humans, but itâ€™s one of the major attrition points in drug development. Youâ€™ve been through some of the unpredictability issues with Cladribine/Gilenya, where there was an interaction that wasnâ€™t predicted. But once people try it, the doctors can see patterns and work out whatâ€™s going on. Clemastine/metformin is very exciting, and given what youâ€™ve said about your current condition and your personal risk tolerance it makes sense to try it. It definitely wouldnâ€™t be for everyone.",gilenya,2,,,
"Interesting that it only targets S1P-1/5 receptors rather than 1-5 like Fingolimod. Hoping to soon see what the AEs and SAEs were Yes. I'm not sure what this means, exactly:  Quote Nine patients reported serious adverse events (2 mg: 3/29 [10.3%], 1.25 mg: 1/43 [2.3%], 0.5 mg: 4/29 [13.8%], and 0.25 mg: 1/50 [2.0%]; no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient and no new safety signals occurred compared with the BOLD Study. If there were 9 patients reporting SAEs, how can it be stated that ""no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...""? Maybe I haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. I'm very pleased that something is being developed for SPMS, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.",fingolimod,2,,,

"Hi everybody, My latest MRI results for Brain and Cervical Cord are in and my next Neurologist appointment is in the next couple of weeks. Thereâ€™re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and Iâ€™ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : â€œLesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.â€ That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.",gilenya,1,,,
I canâ€™t give you advice about Lemtrada because I chose Cladribine. Have you thought about this drug? The doctors at Barts are keen to give it to people with SPMS.

"Well as expected my Neurologist wants me to start Tysabri, I kept saying that I wasnâ€™t happy and he kept saying Yes you are! But I am still NOT, If Lemtrada was available here I think I would definitely go for that,but like every thing here we are way behind, it took 8 years longer than Australia to get Gilenya and Tysabri? I am taking Gilenya every second day,but my vitals are still low,white blood count 1.9 last week? On the day I donâ€™t take I am a box of birds,as normal as I can be! Again I really Donâ€™t want this Tysabri! And am considering just not attending! I have voiced my concerns_But? It seems even on it,if you tolerate ok, the average time until you have to stop though becoming JVC positive is two years?",gilenya,2,,,
"Why do you think that FIngolimod was such a miserable failure in progressive MS trial in humans (not animals) that was aborted by Biogen?

"Thank you so muchâ€¦Iâ€™m learning a lot here at GRACE.  I should have mentioned my husbandâ€™s cancer is in his bones, liver, adrenal, in addition to lung and brain mets as I mentioned.   I truly appreciate the comments on hospice as we just started hospice a few weeks agoâ€¦my insurance allows palliative care along with continued anti-cancer treatment.  I only thought of hospice as end-of-life care, thus was hesitant, but it has truly been a blessing as theyâ€™ve helped with equipment, medicine, and twice weekly visits give us a bit of a measurement of how my husband is doing.  They have been extremely helpful.   I meant to askâ€¦does Opdivo and/or Tagrisso penetrate the blood brain barrier?  Iâ€™ve heard yes and no.  My husband had just started Opdivo (only 5 treatments) and they switched to Irinotecan chemo because of the brain mets.  After the first chemo, he ended up in the hospital with pneumonia.   Thank you again! Gina",tagrisso,2,,,
"I have no vision in one eye, unrelated to my eye injections. However, when problems began in my good eye, getting injections in that one and only eye is always a horrifying experience - mentally. It is still scary till today, you don't get used to it. I have had many eye injections. My first was when I was 43 years old, 7 years ago. I developed an eye infection, but no one could pinpoint what it exactly was. So one by one, every antibiotic was injected in the eye for a period of 6 weeks, and totalling 24 injections. It was a big relief when the last antibiotic available did the job, as there were no other options left after that. Two years later, I had cataract surgery. Within a week I developed retinal vein occlusion. Also, macular oedema came into play as well. And so began the Avasrin injections and then Lucentis. I would be getting them very frequently. And a year later, it became monthly injections. I have now stopped counting. Sometimes after an injection, it becomes pitch black for me. The first time I was terrified. But then I was told it was due to eye pressured and after a few Injures, all came back to normal. Main thing is I make sure what may or may not happen with the procedure and eye condition, so at least I am prepared. It's true, in Australia, neither Lucentis nor Eylea were covered by the government unless one had macular degeneration. Even though the other conditions are also vision threatening. Eylea has extended the time period between each of my injections, and that is the biggest milestone achieved to date. I am so grateful to my ALL of my ophthalmologists who have gone above and beyond their profession, to make the injection process as comfortable as they possibly can for me. And as for the researchers, well done and keep it going. The eye is priceless.",lucentis,1,,,
"There is significant bleeding in the right eye, so that will need laser and possibly surgery longer term. There is thankfully less in the left, so they will treat with injections, then assess.  Click to expand... Ah, OK. It was just that you mentioned macular oedema (which doesn't cause vitreous haemorrhage) but didn't mention proliferative diabetic retinopathy or PDR (which can cause vitreous haemorrhages). I know you mentioned laser, but there are different types and sometimes macular oedema is treated with macular laser. The type used for PDR is called PRP (pan-retinal photocoagulation) and is applied to the periphery of the retina.

"Objective To review the evidence supporting the European Union marketing authorization of drugs for multiple sclerosis (MS) and assess how far postmarketing research addresses information gaps at the time of approval. Methods Through its database, we identified drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency and gathered data on pivotal trials from the European Public Assessment Reports and corresponding publications. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and trial registries for postmarketing randomized controlled trials testing the drugs identified in any form of the disease. Results Since approval of interferon and glatiramer up to 2017, the Agency has examined 10 drugs for the treatment of MS, and 8 were included in this study: alemtuzumab, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fampridine, fingolimod, peginterferon-Î²-1a, natalizumab, and teriflunomide. We analyzed 16 pivotal trials enrolling almost 16,000 participants. Eleven compared new drugs to placebo, 5 to interferon-Î²-1a. Annualized relapse rate was the primary outcome in two-thirds and coprimary with disability progression in the 2 studies of alemtuzumab. Of the 52 postmarketing trials, 24 reported final results and 28 were ongoing, terminated, or completed but no results were available. None directly compared the approved drugs, thus leaving their respective therapeutic values unknown. Data on the prevention of disease progression were scarce: none of the disease-modifying drugs showed any effect on disability progression. Conclusion The lack of comparative evidence and data on clinical effectiveness hamper the assessment of therapeutic value and place in therapy of drugs approved for MS.",fingolimod,2,,,
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an inflammatory process involving different areas of the central nervous system (CNS) at various points in time.  What Causes This Disease? The cause of multiple sclerosis is not known. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to predispose a person to develop the disease. Multiple sclerosis results in the destruction of the myelin that surrounds the nerves of the CNS. Myelin is a fatty substance that insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain. If the myelin is damaged, the transmitted information is not only delayed but also may be misinterpreted by the brain. The myelin destruction, also known as demyelination, is thought to be caused by the body's immune cells entering the CNS. The disruption of the normal barrier to the entry of these cells, termed the blood-brain barrier, leads to local swelling (known as edema ). Also damaged are the nerve cell bodies (termed neuronal loss) or their prolongations (termed axonal loss). A plaque (area of inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, edema or scarring) represents a typical multiple sclerosis lesion , or area of injury. What initially triggers the immune system attack is not known. Microglia are cells in the CNS that take up fragments of myelin and present these fragments to the immune cells. In healthy individuals, this presentation of myelin fragments is not thought to trigger the immune cells to attack the CNS. In people with multiple sclerosis, this presentation of myelin fragments may trigger an exaggerated response by immune cells that leads to the formation of plaques around the blood vessels in the CNS.  What Are the Signs and Symptoms? Share Your Story Perhaps the most common symptom of MS is sensory disturbance, which manifests as tingling or numbness sensations, throughout the body. Visual disturbances are also among the most common symptoms and: Blurred or hazy vision Color perception alteration Vision loss may occur because of the development of optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve). In a typical case of optic neuritis, the person with multiple sclerosis experiences ocular pain with eye movement. Other common symptoms include: Loss of balance and fine motor skills Facial pain or weakness  Vertigo (a spinning sensation) Limb weakness or paralysis Impaired control of bladder or bowel function  Fatigue Depression Memory loss Individuals with advanced disease lose the ability to walk and may become bedridden, requiring assistance with most activities.  Is There a Cure for MS? No, currently there is no vaccine or treatment cure for multiple sclerosis.  What Drugs Treat the Symptoms? Share Your Story Several medications are now available to decrease the number of attacks (periods of relapse) of multiple sclerosis or delay the progression of physical disability. Your doctor or health care professional my prescribe medications and other therapies to treat general symptoms associated with the disease, such as depression, muscle spasms, fatigue, bladder problems, tremors (shakiness), poor coordination, and sexual dysfunction.  Interferons and glatiramer acetate (Capaxone) Interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), are examples of immune-modifying drugs used for MS. Generally, these medications tend to decrease the frequency of attacks in patients with mild-to-moderate relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) by 18% to 33%. The rate of new lesions that appear on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also reduced by approximately one-third. With the interferon drugs, the effectiveness is directly related to the dose (higher doses of IFN, if tolerated, are generally more effective). Whether the delay in the onset of new attacks by these drugs ultimately has a long-term impact on the disability associated with multiple sclerosis is controversial. However, clinical trials suggest that patients receiving early treatment have a beneficial impact on relapses and disability that may not be matched by patients in whom the treatment is delayed. Research regarding this continues. The ability to respond to long-term interferon beta-1a and beta-1b may be limited, in some patients, by the development of persistent, high titer neutralizing antibodies. Patients treated with glatiramer also eventually develop antibodies, but these antibodies do not seem to limit glatiramer's activity.   Multiple Sclerosis Slideshow  Make an MS-Friendly Home  Take the MS Quiz Corticosteroids Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) is the corticosteroid most frequently used intravenously to speed up the recovery from MS attacks. It is most helpful if administered shortly (within a few days) after the onset of the attack.  How corticosteroids work: Corticosteroids affect immunologic actions, such as inflammation (swelling) and immune responses associated with an acute (sudden) attack of multiple sclerosis. Corticosteroids are used for short periods to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms associated with a sudden attack.  Who should not use these medications: Individuals allergic to corticosteroids Individuals with active  peptic ulcer disease Individuals with systemic  fungal infections Who should use caution in using these medications: People with  diabetes ,  seizures ,  hypertension ,  congestive heart failure ,  osteoporosis ,  tuberculosis or viral infections, or impaired  liver function People taking other medications (These people should consult their doctor because levels of some medications may be elevated when used along with corticosteroids.)  Use: Solu-Medrol is administered intravenously (IV) for 3-5 days to treat a sudden multiple sclerosis attack.  Steroids do not have an impact on the degree of clinical recovery, but rather in shortening the timing to recovery.  Drug or food interactions: Many drug interactions are possible. Contact a doctor or pharmacist before taking a new prescription or over-the-counter medications.  Aspirin ; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (  Advil ) or naproxen (  Aleve ); or other medications associated with stomach ulcers may increase the risk of developing stomach ulcers. Corticosteroids may decrease potassium levels; therefore, caution must be used when taking other medications that decrease potassium levels, such as diuretics, for example,  furosemide (Lasix).  Side effects: Ideally, corticosteroids are used for short periods in order to control sudden flares in  multiple sclerosis symptoms . Short-term use may cause fluid retention, potassium loss, stomach distress, weight gain, and changes in emotion. Long-term use is associated with serious side effects such as  osteoporosis (calcium and  vitamin D supplementation is advised), adrenal insufficiency, psychosis, immunosuppression,  peptic ulcer ,  hypertension ,  insomnia , menstrual irregularities,  acne , skin atrophy, elevated  blood sugar , abnormal appearance of the face (Cushingoid face), increased risk of infection, and  cataracts . Induction of problems with blood sugar levels and worsening of  diabetes control: Changes in  diet or initiating oral antidiabetic medications or insulin may be required. For individuals who already have  diabetes , dosage changes may be needed for the insulin or the antidiabetic medications. Weight gain: This is a common problem with high-dose corticosteroids due to fluid retention and endocrine alterations. Salt restriction is advised, and with a doctor's approval, potassium supplementation may be needed. A doctor may prescribe a diuretic (water pill) to increase urination to eliminate some of the excess fluid.  Immunosuppressants Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved immunosuppressant used for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Other immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine (Imuran), or methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), are prescribed primarily in specialized centers; but their efficacy in multiple sclerosis remains controversial and they are not FDA approved for this use. These drugs should not substitute for the immune-modulating drugs as first-line agents in newly diagnosed relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Some physicians find a role for Cytoxan, Imuran, and methotrexate as last-resort measures for patients who have not responded to the FDA approved drugs or that have a fulminant ( malignant ) course of multiple sclerosis that may be life threatening. How immunosuppressants work: This group includes a wide variety of agents that work in many different ways, but they all interfere in the immune-system processes that cause inflammation.  Who should not use these medications: Individuals allergic to any of these medications Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding Individuals with preexisting bone marrow suppression Individuals with diseases causing low blood count  Dosing: Depending on the drug prescribed, immunosuppressants may be administered orally or intravenously.  Drug or food interactions: The use of immunosuppressants increases the risk of infection, increases toxicity to bone marrow or blood cells, and may lead to  cancer . Many drug interactions are possible. Contact a doctor or pharmacist before beginning a new prescription or over-the-counter medication.  Side effects: Immunosuppressants are not safe during  pregnancy , may cause bone marrow or blood cell toxicity, or may lead to  cancer . Patients with impaired kidney or liver function may need lower doses and close monitoring. Methotrexate may cause toxicity of the liver or lungs (fibrosis or pneumonitis) and even damage to the nervous system (leukoencephalopathy or myelopathy). Mitoxantrone may cause heart problems and requires monitoring with echocardiograms (  ultrasonography of the heart) before and during therapy. Cyclophosphamide may cause  bleeding within the bladder and even  bladder cancer . Follow the doctor's recommendations on fluid intake while taking these medications.  Indications for Immunosuppressant Drugs in multiple sclerosis Mitoxantrone (Novantrone): indicated for reducing neurologic disability and/or the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (i.e., patients whose neurologic status is significantly abnormal between relapses). Novantrone is not indicated in the treatment of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Other Therapies Available for MS Symptoms Fingolimod (Gilenya): Fingolimod (Gilenya) is a daily oral medication to treat MS that was approved by the US FDA in September 2010 as the first oral medication to treat MS. Although the exact mechanism of action of fingolimod is unclear, it appears to work by reducing the number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is important for immunity and the inflammation process) in the blood. Fingolimod is taken daily in capsule form. It is not a cure for MS, but it has been shown to decrease the number of MS flares and slow down the development of physical disability caused by MS. Like many injectable therapies for MS, the long-term safety of fingolimod is unknown. The most common side effects of fingolimod are headache , flu, diarrhea , back pain, elevations of liver enzymes in the blood, and cough . Other side effects are also possible including eye problems , so those taking this drug should have regular ophthalmologic evaluations. Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange): This therapy is sometimes attempted for treatment of severe attacks of the disease that do not respond to corticosteroids. This therapy is expensive, not FDA approved for multiple sclerosis, and its efficacy is controversial. IV immune globulin (IVIG): Although not FDA approved for multiple sclerosis, some studies have suggested that IVIG can reduce the rate of a second attack when IVIG was administered over 6 weeks following a first attack. Other researchers found no benefit when given to patients who had the condition for at least 3 years. Yet others have studied IVIG when given on a regular monthly schedule and found a small but significant benefit of improving clinical disabilities and fewer relapses.  New Investigational Drugs Research into additional treatment options continues to advance. Multiple approaches are being investigated based on the increasing knowledge about immune system abnormalities and CNS lesion formation in multiple sclerosis. These include approaches to counteract or reduce immune system activation, blood brain barrier disruption, neuronal loss, and myelin loss, among other investigational efforts.",gilenya,2,,,

Read the entire detailed patient monograph for Humira (Adalimumab Injection Solution for Subcutaneous Administration) Learn More Â»  Rheumatoid Arthritis Slideshow  Take the RA Quiz  Joint-Friendly Exercises Slideshow Humira Professional Information SIDE EFFECTS The most serious adverse reactions described elsewhere in the labeling include the following:  Serious Infections [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ] Malignancies [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reaction with HUMIRA was injection site reactions. In placebocontrolled trials, 20% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RAII, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking HUMIRA and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of HUMIRA in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).  Infections In the controlled portions of the 39 global HUMIRA clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 HUMIRA-treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and postsurgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ].  Tuberculosis And Opportunistic Infections In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian HUMIRA-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ].  Autoantibodies In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with HUMIRA and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with HUMIRA developed clinical signs suggestive of newonset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy. No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with HUMIRA on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.  Liver Enzyme Elevations There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of controltreated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between HUMIRA and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of HUMIRA in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of HUMIRA and MTX than those treated with HUMIRA alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of HUMIRA treatment. No ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of HUMIRA in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with CD with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of HUMIRA in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations â‰¥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of HUMIRA (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of HUMIRA-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of HUMIRA (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in HUMIRA-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations â‰¥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of HUMIRA-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.  Immunogenicity Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6- to 12-month period. Approximately 5% (58 of 1062) of adult RA patients receiving HUMIRA developed low-titer antibodies to adalimumab at least once during treatment, which were neutralizing in vitro. Patients treated with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients on HUMIRA monotherapy (1% versus 12%). No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of HUMIRA is unknown. In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years of age, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 16% of HUMIRA-treated patients. In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence was 6% compared to 26% with HUMIRA monotherapy. In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 7% (1 of 15) of HUMIRA-treated patients, and the one patient was receiving concomitant MTX. In patients with AS, the rate of development of antibodies to adalimumab in HUMIRA-treated patients was comparable to patients with RA. In patients with PsA, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA monotherapy was comparable to patients with RA; however, in patients receiving concomitant MTX the rate was 7% compared to 1% in RA. In adult patients with CD, the rate of antibody development was 3%. In pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 3%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 32% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 10%. In patients with moderately to severely active UC, the rate of antibody development in patients receiving HUMIRA was 5%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 25% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In patients with Ps, the rate of antibody development with HUMIRA monotherapy was 8%. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 40% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 20.7%. In Ps patients who were on HUMIRA monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal. Anti-adalimumab antibodies were measured in clinical trials of subjects with moderate to severe HS with two assays (an original assay capable of detecting antibodies when serum adalimumab concentrations declined to < 2 mcg/mL and a new assay that is capable of detecting antiadalimumab antibody titers in all subjects, independent of adalimumab concentration). Using the original assay, the rate of anti-adalimumab antibody development in subjects treated with HUMIRA was 6.5%. Among subjects who stopped HUMIRA treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to < 2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied), the immunogenicity rate was 28%. Using the new titer-based assay, antiadalimumab antibody titers were measurable in 61% of HS subjects treated with HUMIRA. Antibodies to adalimumab were associated with reduced serum adalimumab concentrations. In general, the extent of reduction in serum adalimumab concentrations is greater with increasing titers of antibodies to adalimumab. No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed. In adult patients with non-infectious uveitis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 4.8% (12/249) of patients treated with adalimumab. However, due to the limitation of the assay conditions, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/mL. Among the patients whose serum adalimumab levels were < 2 mcg/Ml (approximately 23% of total patients studied), the immunogenicity rate was 21.1%. Using an assay which could measure an anti-adalimumab antibody titer in all patients, titers were measured in 39.8% (99/249) of non-infectious uveitis adult patients treated with adalimumab. No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to adalimumab or titers, and are highly dependent on the assay. The observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to adalimumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.  Other Adverse Reactions Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies The data described below reflect exposure to HUMIRA in 2468 patients, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). HUMIRA was studied primarily in placebo- controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most patients received 40 mg HUMIRA every other week. Table 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in patients treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs. In Study JIA-I, HUMIRA was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with HUMIRA and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster. In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in HUMIRA-treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with HUMIRA were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving HUMIRA was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of HUMIRA treatment. In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash. In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with HUMIRA who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial. Approximately 15% of patients treated with HUMIRA developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK levels decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue HUMIRA without interruption. In Study JIA-II, HUMIRA was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving HUMIRA in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella. In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity.  Psoriatic Arthritis And Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 395 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebocontrolled trials and in an open label study and in 393 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies. The safety profile for patients with PsA and AS treated with HUMIRA 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA, HUMIRA Studies RA-I through IV.  Adult Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1478 adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in four placebocontrolled and two open-label extension studies. The safety profile for adult patients with CD treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Pediatric Crohn's Disease Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 192 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease in one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for pediatric patients with Crohn's disease treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in adult patients with Crohn's disease. During the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with HUMIRA were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively). A total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving HUMIRA in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. A total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving HUMIRA in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis. In Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions.  Ulcerative Colitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1010 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in two placebocontrolled studies and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for patients with UC treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Plaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, HUMIRA-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%).  Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebocontrolled studies and one open-label extension study. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with HUMIRA weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of HUMIRA. Flare of HS, defined as â‰¥25% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from HUMIRA treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies.  Uveitis Clinical Studies HUMIRA has been studied in 464 adult patients with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric patients with uveitis (Study PUV-I). The safety profile for patients with UV treated with HUMIRA was similar to the safety profile seen in patients with RA.  Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMIRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to HUMIRA exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia Hepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis Immune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome), cerebrovascular accident Respiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism Skin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction Vascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis",humira,2,,,

Good luck Reg. A few days ago i went to listen to a top neuro speak on new treatments for progressive MS at our local hospital. Ocrevus was one of them. I went in quite curious and came out quite confused. He was recommending it but unfortunately it's not available up here in Canada yet. He said there's a way to get it but no ones trained to administer it. It sounds like it's the best bet so far. I'm very interested in hearing how you make out and in hearing any observations that you might make afterwards. Thanks for posting.,ocrevus,2,,,
"BMC Ophthalmol. 2019 Jan 8;19(1):8. Intravitreal dexamethasone implants versus intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment in treating patients with retinal vein occlusion: a meta-analysis. Gao L et al. Background : Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common retinal venous disorder that causes vision loss. No specific therapy has been developed. Controversy exists regarding two treatments: intravitreal dexamethasone implants and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of dexamethasone implants and anti-VEGF treatment for RVO. Methods : The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies comparing dexamethasone implants with anti-VEGF in patients with RVO. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), intraocular pressure changes, conjunctival haemorrhage, reduced VA, and macular oedema were extracted from the final included studies. RevMan 5.3 was used to conduct the quantitative analysis and bias assessment. Results : Four randomised controlled trials assessing 969 eyes were included. The anti-VEGF treatment showed better BCVA improvement (mean difference [MD] = - 10.59, P < 0.00001) and more CST decrease (MD = - 86.71 Î¼m, P = 0.02) than the dexamethasone implants. However, the dexamethasone implants required fewer injections. As for adverse effects, the dexamethasone implants showed significantly higher intraocular pressure (IOP) and more cataracts than the anti-VEGF treatment. No significant differences were found in conjunctival haemorrhage, reduced VA, and macular oedema. Conclusion : Anti-VEGF treatment showed better functional and anatomical improvement with less risk of IOP elevation and cataract formation compared to dexamethasone implants. Thus, anti-VEGF treatment is the first choice for treating RVO patients. PMID: 30621640 PMCID: PMC6325672 DOI: 10.1186/s12886-018-1016-7",dexamethasone,1,,,

"Hello Snigdha, My father was diagnosed with lung cancer in July, 2012. He took Tarceva, then Iressa and then Tagrisso. He took Tagrisso for the last ten months.

Tagrisso was really good for him. I'd like to tell you that during his hospital admission he had some heart issues. Doctors say this may be caused by Tagrisso. My father hasn't done heart exams after starting with Tagrisso. I don't know if the exams could have made him live more. Maybe would be good if you talk to a cardiologist.

"You mention 8 recent developments and 25 issues of interest regarding progressive MS and thus create the immpression of massive ongoing activity around it. Yet, a careful examination reveals that you only talk about drugs, or ways to enhance (drug) trial designs. Even the information quest is under the umbrella of drug trials: you tend to support your arguments on interpetation of these trials, not on basic research. Wherever there is hard evidence present, you eagerly set it aside as circumstantial. If you took a step back you could see how disproportionally drug-orientanted is the road you offer. It is destined to fail in the long run. Remember the worn-away hype of Infs, Gilenya, Tysabri, BG-12 and alemtuzumab. You still talk about newer drugs, stretch the expectations to point break and then again some more. First T, then B, then memory-B, then T again, then both, then what?

"Hi and thank you for your replies. I have not officially been offered anything really. When they were looking for a treatment that would treat psoriasis as well as my ms my neuro mentioned rituximab and that he would wait to see the dermatologist, the letter said I could be moved to any one of the 3 fairly easily but he wanted to take advice first. The dermatologist said that retuximab wouldnt work and I heard him say I will probably be giving her Gilenya then. But Iâ€™m very scared of the side effect with your eyes as Iâ€™m already at risk with having diabetes. So I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a risk Iâ€™m willing to take. The ms nurse sent me info on the all three treatments and after reading that it supports my worries. Iâ€™m leaning towards the tysabri myself but I donâ€™t know if I can say no.

Was forced to find a new GP when I moved three years ago. The current one is a good GP, but I still miss my old one sometimes. Plus he was a lot more lax about prescribing stuff, which I know shouldn't be a reason for wanting to stay with a GP - but yeah, for me it is. As for my GI I've been with him for seven years now, and not looking forward to the day he leaves. If his replacement isn't as good, I'll have to make a decision whether to switch hospital or not.

"No problem. I know how hard and lonely this journey can be, and I'm happy to help. So, his doctors feel the Tecentriq is keeping him stable? If so, that's great! A few random thoughts: 1) If insurance isn't covering the Tecentriq, you could try appealing to the drugmaker. They sometimes do provide the medication free of charge in return for monitoring the progress. 2) Have they considered gamma knife for the brain lesions which weren't surgically removed? My mom's doctors basically decided that would be their approach if she gets little spots that pop up. 3) If the Tecentriq does prove to be working, then you'll probably be on the ""bridge"" journey. Nowadays, there are so many advances coming out - for many cancers it seems to be a breakthrough every year or two. New treatments for SCLC were nonexistent for the last 30 years, but something happened about 2 years ago, and now it seems like there are lots of promising developments every few months. So, the idea is a new treatment comes out, and if it works, that will be a bridge to get a patient to the next point. If and when the bridge stops working (they usually do at some point), then there will be something new to provide the next bridge - that's the hope anyway.

"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323006.php New multiple sclerosis culprit identified It is still unclear what causes multiple sclerosis, but new research closes in on the faulty immune system mechanisms involved in the development of this condition.   New research has identified another type of immune cell that may play a role in MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is an autoimmune disease, causes the immune system to mistakenly attack myelin . Myelin is the substance that coats axons, which are the projections that allow neurons to connect and transmit information. This process is known as demyelination, and it affects the correct functioning of the central nervous system . The condition is characterized by problems with balance and coordination, as well as with eyesight, to name but a few of its effects. In the United States, MS affects 250,000â€“350,000 people. Researchers still donâ€™t know for sure what causes MS, but little by little, they are uncovering the mechanisms at play and revealing more of the cellular culprits involved. Now, neurologist Roland Martin and immunologist Mireia Sospedra â€” at the University of Zurich and University Hospital Zurich, both in Switzerland â€” and colleagues have shown that a type of immune cell called B cells are key to the autoimmune reactions that characterize MS. In a study whose results are now published in the journal Cell, the scientists explain that B cells influence the activity of another type of immune cell, T cells, which then cause inflammation . â€œWe were able to show for the first time that certain B cells â€” the cells of the immune system that produce antibodies â€” activate the specific T cells that cause inflammation in the brain and nerve cell lesions .â€ Roland Martin B cells influence T cells Studies into MS will tend to focus on the role played by T cells in the development of this condition, since T cells are tasked with triggering an appropriate immune response once they detect the presence of pathogens. When T cells malfunction and mistake healthy cells in the body for pathogens, this causes harmful lesions and inflammation, associated with autoimmune diseases such as MS. Martin and colleagues, however, found that the T cells may actually be mistakenly activated by other specialized immune cells: the B cells. This became apparent to the researchers after they observed the effects of certain drugs used to treat MS. Martin says, â€œA class of MS drugs called Rituximab and Ocrelizumab led us to believe that B cells also played an important part in the pathogenesis of the disease.â€ These drugs, the authors note, halt brain inflammation by removing B cells, which suggests that these immune cells are ultimately responsible for the T cellsâ€™ activity. A chain of reactions In order to better understand the role played by B cells in inflammation, the researchers analyzed blood samples from people with MS through an experimental in vitro method. They noticed that B cells were interacting with specialized T cells, boosting their activity, and influencing them to divide more â€” thus feeding their attack cycle. It became clear that B cells were the cause of T cell activity because, when they eliminated the former, the latter stopped proliferating. â€œThis means that we can now explain the previously unclear mechanism of these MS drugs,â€ explains Martin. The investigators also note that the activated T cells they studied in the blood samples include the population of T cells that are active in brain inflammation related to MS. Martin and his team suggest that the T cells are able to read both the proteins released by B cells and recognize the nerve cells in the brain. The scientists say that T cells are first activated in the peripheral blood, only to migrate to the brain, where they end up attacking myelin. â€œOur findings not only explain how new MS drugs take effect, but also pave the way for novel approaches in basic research and therapy for MS,â€ says Martin.",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"Hello everyone  I'm new here and this is the first post I've made. I was diagnosed with MS in May this year after having several sudden, serious attacks January-May. My diagnosis was delayed because I also have Graves Disease (post thyroidectomy) and amongst my myriad symptoms my biggest complaint was intense chest pain. The doctors were so focused on the chest pain they basically ignored my other symptoms for months. It was almost a relief to receive the diagnosis after I was finally referred to a physician who examined me properly and ordered the necessary MRI's. I started transitioning to the OMS lifestyle as best I could as soon as I was diagnosed. I am not great with doing meditation (I do use music a lot though) but I've been making a huge effort with diet and exercise. I've had periods of struggle with the diet and haven't been fully adhering to it (most of the difficulty has been with social situations with family and friends) but I'm just about there and I'm really enjoying this way of eating now. One thing I do not adhere to though is the flax oil, I have been taking fish oil + vitamin e because I simply feel better when I'm taking fish oil. (I still use flax oil on toast instead of butter, and include linseeds in my diet). I also started taking vitamin d and am getting my serum level up to around 100 at least. Got it up from 65 nmol/l to 85 nmol/l over winter. But once I had the MRI's, things started moving very quickly on the DMD front. Based on my MRI's and symptoms my neurologist wanted me on a DMD ASAP and ran me through all the options right after examining me and taking me through the radiology report. She ruled out the Interferon's off the bat, and discussed Tecfidera, Aubagio, Gilenya, Tysabri and Lemtrada with me. She told me her preference would be for Tysabri or Lemtrada, the two that sounded the most terrifying to me. It was pretty overwhelming, I left the clinic after that first appointment barely holding it together and cried most of the walk home, again. I couldn't consider Lemtrada because I have multiple autoimmune diseases with a history of Graves Disease, and I couldn't consider Tecfidera because (at the time) I couldn't handle the prospect of a drug that causes nausea like that. I'd had hideous nausea on and off for months at that stage. I ended up focusing on Gilenya and Tysabri while they were doing all the pre-screening tests, and I was leaning towards Gilenya until I knew my JCV status. It took over a month, but once I had all the results back, knew I was JCV negative and had had enough time to gather all the information and emotionally reconcile myself with the risk of PML, I chose to start on Tysabri as a first line of treatment. I've had 5 treatments now and at the moment, I'm really glad I chose this drug. I tolerate it very well and have had basically no side-effects. About a week after my first infusion I had another attack, but it was far milder than those I'd had earlier this year with no pain or loss of mobility, only 2 patches of numbness on my leg and torso (which didn't spread!) , a bit of weakness and slight worsening of my balance. After the second infusion I just felt like rubbish for the whole month, extremely lethargic and listless and I had the worst brain-fog I've ever experienced. It was very unpleasant. The third treatment was a turning point though. I noticed an improvement DURING the infusion, I could feel my head clearing. I felt so refreshed and full of energy after that treatment I all but ran and skipped out of the hospital that day, it was amazing. I haven't gotten quite that kick out of my last 2 treatments but I've still had steady improvements in how I feel and lingering symptoms. The paresthesia in my feet finally went away! The only symptoms I currently have are white flashes in the peripheral of my left eye and occasional pain in my ribs, a memento of one of the spinal lesions. I hope I can continue on this drug without any serious events. I tend to joke and belittle the risk of PML because it's just one of the ways I deal with it. And having OMS to focus on while trying to make this decision and going through all this has also been a huge help. It makes the future feel a lot less bleak.",gilenya,2,,,

Read this leaflet carefully before you use Humira and keep it with the medicine. You may need to read it again.  What Humira is used for Humira is used for the treatment of: Rheumatoid arthritis Humira is used to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, a painful disease of the joints, as well as slow down and protect against damage to joints. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint pain, tenderness, swelling and stiffness. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Humira is used for reducing the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which is an inflammatory disease involving multiple joints, in patients 2 years of age and older. Enthesitis-related arthritis Humira is used to treat enthesitis-related arthritis, an inflammatory disease of the joints in children. Psoriatic arthritis Humira is used to reduce the signs and symptoms, as well as inhibit the progression of joint damage of moderate to severely active psoriatic arthritis, a disease of the joints and skin, with some similarities to rheumatoid arthritis, as well as psoriasis and other factors. Ankylosing spondylitis Humira is used to reduce the signs and symptoms in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory disease of the spine. Signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis include back pain and morning stiffness. Crohn's Disease Humira is used for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the digestive tract, in adults and children aged 6 years and above to reduce the signs and symptoms of the disease and to induce and maintain periods where the symptoms are no longer present. Humira can be given to patients who have not responded well enough to conventional therapies, or who have lost response to or are intolerant to infliximab (another medicine used to treat Crohn's disease). Ulcerative Colitis Humira is used for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis an inflammatory bowel disease, in patients who have not responded well enough to conventional therapy or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. Patients should show a response within 8 weeks to continue treatment. Psoriasis Humira is used to treat chronic plaque psoriasis, an inflammatory disease of the skin. Plaque psoriasis can also affect nails, causing them to crumble, thicken and lift away from the nail bed which can be painful. Humira is used for moderate to severe forms of the disease in adults and severe forms in children and adolescents from 4 years of age who have not responded well enough to topical therapy and phototherapy, or who cannot be given those treatments. Hidradenitis suppurativa Humira is used for the treatment of adult and adolescents from 12 years of age with active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa), a chronic and often painful inflammatory skin disease.

It is recommended that children, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. Patients receiving Humira should not receive live vaccines. Tell your doctor if you are a psoriasis sufferer who has undergone phototherapy. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy and continue its use for at least 5 months after the last Humira treatment. Humira should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. A pregnancy study found that there was no higher risk of birth defects when the mother had used Humira during pregnancy, compared with mothers with the same disease who did not use Humira. If you use Humira during pregnancy, your baby may have a higher risk of getting an infection. It is important that you tell your baby's doctors and other healthcare professionals about your Humira use during your pregnancy before the baby receives any vaccine. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether Humira passes into breast milk. If you are breastfeeding, your doctor may advise you to stop breastfeeding while you are using this medicine. If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Humira.  Taking other medicines Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket naturopath or health food shop. Some medicines and Humira may interfere with each other. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while using this medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking anakinra (Kineret) or abatacept (Orencia), other medicines used to treat some forms of arthritis. Taking the two medicines together may increase the risk of infection. Humira can be taken together with medicines used to treat arthritis, such as: methotrexate, steroids or pain medications including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen. Tell your doctor or if you are taking any other medicines to treat your condition.  How to use Humira Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully.

If Humira has no effect on the child's condition after 16 weeks, your doctor may tell you to stop using Humira.  How to use it Humira is injected under the skin. The injection can be self-administered or given by another person, for example a family member or friend after proper training in injection technique, or your doctor or his/her assistant. Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Humira if you are using the Humira Pre-filled Syringe are provided on the Product Information/ Injecting instructions leaflet with the product. Read these instructions carefully and follow them step by step. These instructions explain how to self-inject this medicine. Do not attempt to self-inject until you are sure that you understand how to prepare and give the injection. Your doctor or his/her assistant will also show you best how to self-inject. Do not mix the injection in the same syringe or vial with any other medicine.  Setting up Wash your hands thoroughly Set up the following items on a clean surface - One pre-filled syringe of Humira for injection. - One alcohol pad. Look at the expiry date on the syringe. Do not use the product after the month and year shown. Check the colour has not changed and that there are no particles in the solution. If it is cloudy or discoloured or has flakes or particles in it, you must not use it. Do not use it if the solution is frozen.  Choosing an injection site Choose a site on your thigh or stomach (except the area around the navel). Change the place that you inject each time so that you do not become sore in one area. Each new injection should be given at least 3 cm from the last injection site Rotate between thigh and stomach  Preparing an Injection Site Do not inject in an area where the skin is tender, reddened, bruised, or hard. This may mean there is an infection. Wipe the injection site with the enclosed alcohol pad, using a circular motion. Do not touch the area again before injecting.  Injecting Humira Do not shake the syringe The presence of one or more bubbles in the syringe is normal. Remove the cap from needle syringe, being careful not to touch the needle or let it touch any surface. With one hand, gently grasp the cleaned area of skin and hold firmly. With the other hand, hold syringe at 90-degree angle to skin, with the grooved side up. With one quick, short motion, push needle all the way into skin Release the skin with the first hand Push plunger to inject solution - it can take from 2 to 5 seconds to empty the syringe. When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from skin, being careful to keep it at the same angle as when it was inserted Using your thumb or a piece of gauze, apply pressure over the injection site for 10 seconds. A little bleeding may occur. Do not rub the injection site. Use a plaster if you want to.  Throwing away supplies The Humira syringe should never be reused. Never recap a needle. After injecting Humira, immediately throw away the used syringe in a special 'sharps' container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Keep this container out of the reach and sight of children  How long to use it Keep using Humira for as long as your doctor tells you. Humira will not cure your condition but should help control your symptoms. Ask your doctor if you are not sure how long to take this medicine for.  If you forget to use it If you forget to give yourself an injection, you should inject the next dose of Humira as soon as you remember. Then inject your next dose as you would have on your originally scheduled day, had you not forgotten a dose. Do not try to make up for missed doses by taking more than one dose at a time.  If you use too much (overdose) If you accidentally inject Humira more frequently than told to by your doctor, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Australia: Telephone 13 11 26), or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention. Always take the outer carton of the medicine with you.  While you are using Humira Things you must do Check with your doctor before you receive any vaccines. It is recommended that children, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy. Some vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should not be given while receiving Humira. If you become pregnant while using Humira, tell your doctor immediately. If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor you are using Humira. Tell all doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who are treating you that you are using Humira. If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are using Humira. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. Keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked.  Things you must not do Do not give Humira to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. Do not use Humira to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. Do not stop taking Humira, without checking with your doctor. Do not take Humira and anakinra (Kineret) together. Do not take Humira and abatacept (Orencia) together. Anakinra and abatacept are other medicines used to treat certain forms of arthritis.  Things to be careful of It is important to tell your doctor if you get symptoms such as fever, wounds, feeling tired or dental problems. You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. These infections may be serious and include tuberculosis, infections caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria, or other opportunistic infections and sepsis that may, in rare cases, be life-threatening. Your doctor may recommend temporary discontinuation of Humira. Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Humira affects you. The effects on your ability to drive and use machines whilst taking this medicine are not known.  Side effects Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you have any problems while using Humira, even if you do not think the problems are connected with the medicine or are not listed in this leaflet. All medicines have some unwanted side effects. Sometimes they are serious, but most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side-effects. Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist any questions you may have. Tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital if you experience any of the following: Signs of an allergic reaction such as: - Chest tightness - Shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing - Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body - Hives, itching or skin rash Signs and symptoms suggestive of heart failure such as shortness of breath with exertion or upon lying down or swelling of the feet signs and symptoms suggestive of blood disorders such as persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, paleness The above list includes very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are uncommon. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following: Signs of tuberculosis such as persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, fever Signs of infection such as fever, malaise, wounds, dental problems, burning on urination You might get infections more easily while you are receiving Humira treatment. Signs of nervous system disorders such as numbness or tingling throughout your body, arm or leg weakness, double vision Signs of soft tissue infection, such as a bump or open sore that doesn't heal The above list includes serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention. Serious side effects are rare. Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you: Injection site reactions (including pain, swelling, redness or itching) Upper respiratory tract infections (including cold, runny nose, sinus infection, sore throat) Lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis, pneumonia) Ear infections Eye inflammation, inflammation of the eye lid or changes to your vision Headache, dizziness, vertigo, sensation disorders Increased cough, sore throat Abdominal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, Rash, itching Fatigue Mouth inflammation and ulcers Muscle or bone pain Elevated lipids Depression, anxiety Increased heart rate Viral infections (including the flu, cold sore blisters, chicken pox and shingles) Bacterial infections (including Urinary Tract Infection) Fungal Infections Changes in mood, feeling low or anxious The above list includes the more common side effects of Humira. They are usually mild and short-lived.  Laboratory results Some side effects observed with Humira may not have symptoms and may only be discovered through blood tests. These include increased lipids in the blood, elevated liver enzymes, and increased uric acid in the blood. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything else that is making you feel unwell. Other side effects not listed above may occur in some people. There have been cases of certain kinds of cancer in patients taking Humira or other TNF blockers. People with more serious rheumatoid arthritis that have had the disease for a long time may have a higher chance of getting a kind of cancer that affects the lymph system, called lymphoma, or that affects the blood, called leukaemia. If you take Humira your risk may increase. On rare occasions, a specific and severe type of lymphoma has been observed in patients taking Humira. Some of those patients were also treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. In addition very rare cases of skin cancer have been observed in patients taking Humira. If new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance, tell your doctor. There have been cases of cancers other than lymphoma in patients with a specific type of lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with another TNF blocker. If you have COPD, or are a heavy smoker, you should discuss with your doctor whether treatment with a TNF blocker is appropriate for you.  After using Humira Storage Keep your pre-filled syringe in the pack until it is time to use it. Keep Humira in a refrigerator (2Â°C to 8Â°C). Do not freeze. Keep Humira in the refrigerator in a way children cannot get to it. Keep the medicine at the right temperature when you travel. This is important when travelling by car, bus, train, plane or any other form of transport. Store a pre-filled syringe at room temperature (below 25Â°C) for a maximum period of 14 days, protected from light. Once removed from the refrigerator and stored at room temperature, the syringe must be used within 14 days or discarded, even if it is returned to the refrigerator. Write down the date you first remove the syringe from the refrigerator on the label, so you can check how long it has been.  Disposal After injecting Humira, immediately throw away the used pre-filled syringe in a special 'sharps' container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. If your doctor tells you to stop using Humira or the expiry date has passed, ask your pharmacist what to do with any medicine that is left over.

"It was a bit of a surprise if I'm honest. I'd had background retinopathy, and this popped up. The conversation I had with the Optometrist was that this is still effectively background retinopathy, but the proximity to the macula is the concern and so it becomes ""Maculopathy"" with significantly more observation. In an NHS clinical trial, Eylea performed the best of the three drugs on offer for Macula Odoema (The swelling I described in my first post).",eylea,2,,,
"19del > EGFR L858R > EGFR WT (Fig. 3D ); this order nicely mirrors the trend in the experimentally determined affinities of these inhibitors 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 . To further quantify the differential binding of the TKIs with various mutants of EGFR, we calculated their binding free energies using the MMPBSA approach 15 , 16 . Of course afatinib itself is covalently bonded to EGFR and hence one cannot use these classical methods to compute the binding energetics (these can be carried out using quantum mechanical methods 17 , but this is outside the scope of the current study). Therefore we calculated the binding free energies of erlotinib and gefitinib to the wildtype and mutant (L858R/19del) EGFR to explore whether the models we construct are in accord with experiments. It is clear that the calculations mirror the experimental trends in the binding affinities (experimental IC 50 , Figure S5 ). The differences between the experimental affinities for the wild type EGFR at first glance are much larger than the calculated ones; however, upon careful examination of the experimental data available in the literature [2â€“5, 8] we find that the spread in these values for the wild type EGFR is quite large and this is now shown through the error bars.",erlotinib,2,,,

"Hi Nev You may not be able to get Tysabri as it's mostly classed as a 2nd line drug. This means that generally you need to have been on a first line drug and 'failed', i.e. relapsed whilst on it, or have been unable to take it because for eg of a side effect. You can also get it (assuming it's available in your area), if your MS is active, i.e. you've had 2 relapses within a year and MRI shows you have new lesions. It will also depend on what drug therapies are on offer in your area. Tecfidera is now likely to be available everywhere as are all the old injectable drugs (Betaferon, Avonex, Rebif and Copaxone) although often these are in slightly different forms, so Copaxone is now a three times a week drug and Avonex is now Plegridy, a once per 2 weeks subcutaneous rather than weekly intramuscular. Gilenya is another 2nd line drug. Interestingly, Lemtrada is often the first and only drug people have if their MS is highly active. It's an odd situation that people are told to go away and think about what drugs they want, but then find that their options are limited to what is available in their area plus their neurologists preference. Also sometimes a neurologist will describe a persons MS as highly active (which then qualifies them for more drugs) because of the lesions in their brain, which do not always manifest in the number of relapses or symptoms. So, it's good that you know what your preference is, and it's possible that you can get it, but don't become so firmly attached to that choice that you're completely devastated to find you can't have it. There's plenty of other issues related to which DMDs you could be offered. Your MS nurse will be able to tell you what drugs are available in your area and also what drugs the neurologist is likely to offer you. Sue",gilenya,2,,,
"The first quarter of 2016 has been a busy period for the Medical Oncology Group of Australia. A new group of trainees has commenced speciality training in medical oncology and those trainees who recently completed their training, have been awarded fellowships and are moving ahead with their career plans. MOGA membership continues to grow and currently there are 172 trainees and 450 consultant members. Dr Zarnie Lwin, Deputy Chair and I have been progressing the new Workforce Study, having completed a pilot project in late 2015. An extensive online survey will be distributed to all MOGA members in the coming months to gather important new data on our workforce to assist with long term services, facilities and workforce planning.  Oncology drugs and treatments The Oncology Drugs Group, Chaired by Dr Deme Karikios, continues to make good progress in advocating for access to oncology drugs, recording a number of notable achievements. Late in 2015, in response to advice from MOGA breast cancer experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) amended the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule listing of medicines for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and recommended a change to the listing of lapatinib for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. The restriction for trastuzumab emtansine will be amended to allow patients to access following treatment with lapatinib. PBAC also recommended that the restriction wording for nabÂ­ paclitaxel be updated to be consistent with the restriction for trastuzumab. The group has also made submissions for priority approvals for a number of oncology drugs considered at the PBAC March meeting, including: nivolumab in non-small cell lung cancer; bevacizumab in cervical cancer; lenvatinib in thyroid cancer; olaparib in ovarian cancer; and tamoxifen in breast cancer prevention. At the same time, the group indicated support for submissions on: cetuximab in metastatic head and neck cancer; nintedanib in non-small cell lung cancer; and vismodegib in basal cell carcinoma. These listings will address important areas of unmet need for cancer patients, those at increased risk of cancer, and their clinicians. The listings are supported by strong randomised clinical trial data and are in keeping with international clinical best practice. A successful submission supporting the change to the listing for tamoxifen for the primary prevention of breast cancer in patients with moderate or high risk has resulted from a unique collaboration. In 2011, MOGA tabled a position paper prepared by leading Australian breast cancer specialist, Prof Kelly-Anne Phillips â€“ â€˜The use of tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer: implications of recent researchâ€™. This paper presented strong research data supporting approval and listing of tamoxifen through the Therapeutics Goods Administration and the PBAC and its placement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for reduction in the risk of invasive breast cancer in women at moderate or high risk. Since then, Prof Phillips and Prof Fran Boyle, Chair, MOGA Breast Cancer Group and ANZ Breast Cancer Trials Group, have worked with MOGA, the TGA, PBAC, Department of Health and Ageing and AstraZeneca, to enact this change.  Education and professional education Plans are well advanced for the 2016 Australia and Asia Pacific Clinical Oncology Research Development Workshop (ACORD): 11-17 September. Applications have been reviewed and participants offered places on this career enhancing program ( acord.org.au ). Communication Skills for Early Career Oncologists, a new program developed by the Young Oncologist Group of Australia (YOGA) was held in April. This program included a series of workplace related role plays with trained actors and related plenary sessions on burnout, mindfulness and other communicationsâ€™ challenges, that could assist medical oncologists in day-to-day clinical practice. Dr George Au-Yeung, YOGA President, reports: â€œGood communication is core to our profession as medical oncologists. This innovative educational initiative provided young oncologists with a challenging and valuable learning opportunity that helped build their professional communications skills.â€ The MOGA Annual Scientific Meeting â€“ Implementation + Innovation in Immunotherapy â€“ will be held on the Gold Coast (3-5 August). Immunotherapy has become an increasingly important therapeutic strategy for cancer patients and medical oncologists, with clinical trials demonstrating significant clinical advantages in an array of cancer streams. Convenor, Prof Ken Oâ€™ Byrne, is planning a scientific program that will focus on innovative approaches to implementing immunotherapy in practice, including a major immuno-oncology forum convened by Prof Grant MacArthur and Dr Alexander Menzies. Prof Justin Stebbing, from the Imperial College in London, will present the keynote address at the meeting to share his insights on the future of medical oncology.",nivolumab,2,,,
"On the 1 st July, scientific community marked the birthday of Alfred Gilman. Dr Gilman received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his work on G-proteins. These transmembrane proteins, as every neuroscience student knows these days, are the most important components of cellular signaling. They are involved in practically all manner of intercellular communication between brain cells too. THE BEST Prion-like proteins and long-term memory maintenance Despite recent progress in our understanding of brain functions, we still have only a limited knowledge about the formation and storage of long-term memories . A seminal paper published this month can be viewed as a serious breakthrough in this field. Researchers have demonstrated that long-term memories are maintained by prion-like proteins . The protein called CPEB3 was shown to be involved in the process. Like typical prions involved in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, CPEB3 can exist in soluble and aggregated forms. When we learn something, new synaptic connections are made and the soluble form of CPEB3 in the synapses gets converted into insoluble aggregates. These aggregates turn on the synthesis of proteins needed to maintain the memory. New, better compounds for depression Anti-depressants, such as Prozac and other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), work slowly and produce appreciable effects only after many weeks or months of administration. They are also known to be associated with a number of side effects. As a result, many medical professionals voice their concerns about the increasing use of SSRIs. However, new compounds called GABA-NAMS that work on a completely different mechanism may revolutionize the treatment of depression. In animal experiments, they were shown to treat depression in less than 24 hours with minimal side effects. This is a serious improvement compared to SSRIs, and the hopes are high that these drugs will soon be tested on humans. Anti-malarials for treating Parkinsonâ€™s disease Drug repurposing becomes an increasingly common strategy when it comes to looking for new approaches to treat various conditions. The reason for this lies in the fact that many pathological processes share common biochemical mechanisms. As a result, a drug developed for one condition may turn out to be helpful in treating something else. The most resent, and rather remarkable, example of repurposing involves Parkinsonâ€™s disease . It turned out that drugs used for prevention and treatment of malaria , Chloroquine and Amodiaquine, reduce the symptoms and improve the behavior of rats with this disease. There is a hope that these drugs might be quickly developed into a treatment for humans. Fingolimod, a drug for multiple sclerosis, as a treatment for Huntingtonâ€™s disease Another successful drug repurposing story came from the search for treatments for Huntingtonâ€™s disease. It turned out that a 3-month course of fingolimod , a drug for multiple sclerosis, improved memory and restores synaptic plasticity in hippocampus in mice with Huntingtonâ€™s disease . The drug has a good safety profile, and researchers currently plan a study on human patients. Cross-talk between immune system and age-related cognitive decline Last year, researchers from Stanford demonstrated that the blood of young rats reverses the cognitive decline in old animals. Continuing studies on this subject , the scientists found that the opposite is true when the blood of older animals circulates in the body of young rats. It turned out that the blood of older animals contains increased amount of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M). B2M is a component of immune system but also participates in shaping the communication between brain cells. In the experiments, the increased amount of B2M in the blood was clearly linked with worsening performance in memory tests. Interestingly, the effect of B2M is reversible, and the cognitive abilities get restored once B2M level is decreased. The discovery might pave the way for developing targeted drugs for prevention of age-related cognitive decline. THE WORST Humans are probably not so good at distinguishing odors, after all A paper on smell perception published in Science in 2014 claims that humans can distinguish at least a trillion odors. But a new paper published few weeks ago in eLife , a journal with significantly smaller Impact Factor, casts serious doubts on the validity of that claim . This new paper shows that the number of smell heavily depends on the number of participants and the strictness of statistical tests used for the estimation. It also appears that the original claim is based on some unproven assumptions about the human smell perception, which is rather poorly understood at present. Nonetheless, the trillion odor claim is already making its way into the neuroscience textbooks. A case of bad science, perhaps? Vitamin B12 provides no benefit in older people with moderate deficiency The fact that the lack of vitamin B12 leads to serious problems in the nervous system is well established. Vitamin B12 supplementation provides obvious improvements in patients with severe deficiency. These days, vitamin B12 is also routinely prescribed to older patients with moderate and mild deficiency in the hope that the supplement will help to improve their cognitive and motor functions. However, the results of new clinical trial show that B12 supplementation of such patients provides no benefits whatsoever . British researchers gave either B12 pills or placebo to a group of elderly (75 years old and above) patients for one year. At the end of the study, the scientists compared the patients performance in a battery of clinical tests. Surprisingly, not a single difference to the pre-trial results was spotted. Clearly, itâ€™s a time to rethink the current strategy of B12 supplementation. Tiny brain lesions, serious risk of stroke Brain imaging provides lots of information about its state of health. Not all of this information, however, is taken into account by clinicians: the meaning or significance of certain changes in the brain is simply not always clear. One of such traditionally disregarded things is very small lesions which were always viewed as insignificant and normal even in healthy people. But the new findings published this month indicate that these lesions are associated with increased risk of stroke and even death . The risk can be as much as three times higher compared to the patients without lesions. This is clearly something to take into consideration for medical professional. Antidepressants may affect cognitive development by interfering with REM sleep The use of antidepressants has been growing fast in recent years. Many pediatricians even prescribe them to children with various disorders. The latter might be of serious concern, however, as these compounds tend to disturb the so-called â€œrapid eye movementâ€ (REM) sleep. REM sleep is very important for converting our daytime experiences into memories. New findings suggest that REM sleep is particularly crucial during the periods of rapid brain remodeling, i.e. in children and adolescents, when lots of higher cognitive functions and skills get acquired and developed. Antidepressants seriously disturb REM sleep thus potentially affecting childrenâ€™s ability to learn and adapt. Sleep deprivation, not a good nightâ€™s sleep, might be beneficial after traumatic experience Both conventional wisdom and medical advice say that a good nightâ€™s sleep helps to reduce the effects of traumatic events, such as intrusive memories and flashbacks . This might be wrong approach, however. In a recent experiment, researchers subjected people who watched emotionally disturbing movies to either interrupted sleep at the sleep laboratory or allowed them to sleep at the comfort of their homes. It turned out that people from the sleep-deprived group were not as good at remembering the emotionally disturbing details of the movie. Sleep is known to consolidate memories. It appears that sleep deprivation might be helpful in preventing the consolidation of traumatic memories .

"iPoop - That is a reasonable point. The way my GI explained it is that since I tried humira first, there is potential that remicade still may produce significant results. Had I tried remicade first, she said there would essentially be no reason to try humira as there's a great chance it would not work either. She then gave the quick overview of entyvio, which I had never heard of before (somewhat disappointed that never even came up as a possibility with my old GI but I digress) and I was greatly intrigued by that possibility as like you said it focuses specifically on the gi tract, as opposes to blocking wbc from the entire body. I think I'm more interested in trying entyvio at this point. Does it work well with imuran since today marks the one month point? (First day actually of 150 mg) U B - I think you're right in giving an increase in humira a try before moving on. I'm getting tests done this Friday to check humiras levels in my body and to see if I have built up any antibodies. It may show that it's not even worth upping my dosage, or it may show that it's not staying in my system and its time to up it. I may try benedryl, I'll give anything a shot to buy even one night of blissful sleep. Boy do I miss those days! Notsosickgirl - Is bentyl a prescript ion drug or OTC? I may give enemas another shot. I remember I tried one before and I just couldn't hold it... I had to evacuate too quickly. I've also tried proctofoam in the past, but again saw no real results there either. This is my third round of pred and I was on 40 mg for about 5 weeks and I saw mild improvement. It's been the same on 30 mg, things dipped when I got to 20 so I'm staying steady on 30. I never got to 100% on any dose of pred and the nocturnal BMS have been occurring essentially since this flare started last June. Some days I really don't know how I have energy. What keeps me going is imagining how good I'm going to feel and how much energy I'll have once I start getting a full night's sleep. I'll be able to accomplish anything when that day finally comes! After doing research all night, entyvio seems like a better option. That is of course pending results of my upcoming humira blood work. Maybe I'll get lucky and not have to use an IV just yet, maybe upping humira will help. 26 - Diagnosed summer 2014. Left sided colitis.

I stopped my 80 mg of Lipitor. ooooooohhhhhhh what a change. My foot drop is so bad. I missed my lipitor so bad that I restarted it 2 wks ago. Now, I can't get back to where I was. I am now on 40 mg OD and barely feeling the positive aspects of it. I must admit the spasticity is better but I was so much better in Oct. before I stopped it. I can't wait to get my new drug and I wonder if it will go what the lipitor was doing for me. I have high hopes. I am thinking that I will be a bad patient and I will take some Lipitor even if I am in the study (the drug is not contraindicated) if this new drug can't give me what the lipitor did in the past.

I hope to go onto the trial for this as well. I plan to keep taking the lipitor, and if this stuff works, I would expect to be doing even better. The researches have told you there are no contraindications, and from my understanding they work on totally different biological mechanisms. By stopping the lipitor, if you go downhill, there will be no way to tell if it doesnt work at all. It may just not work as well for you as lipitor. I think the real test is if it helps you more than not taking it. ie while still on your existing regimine. Seriously, look after your health as a first priority.

Gradually, with this lipitor, I realized that it is easier for me to get up from the toilet bowl (!) and any other chair. I am not sure it works the same for everyone but it does magic for me. Thanks CureorBust: I agree with you. I may just stay on it since it is not contraindicated but the FTY720 and the lipitor both affect the liver. So I would really have to watch my liver function tests. By the way, TODAY, I saw the neurologist and they gave me 3 months supply of the study drug. OH WHAT A FEELING !!!For the first time, they are accepting me into a study. WOW. Finally I could be on the placebo but I sure hope not.... I feel like I have my lipitor to fall back onto if needed but I would prefer to really have something active. My first dose is in 3 days.... drum roll..... Take care all, I will keep you posted.

"Well you know remicade works well for you, so I'd consider another similar biologic within the same class. Remicade, Cimzia, and Humira are all TNF-Alpha-Blocking biologics. Developing antibodies to one TNF-Alpha-blocker doesn't mean you will develop antibodies to Cimzia/Humira as the molecular structure is different enough that your immune system must start all over again (from the ground-up) with the antibody development process. You might never develop antibodies to Cimzia/Humira, or you could with no increased odds. Stelara is a completely different class of biologics with a completely different mechanism of action.

"Hi Janine, Thanks for your response but due to the word limit, I was unable to make it clear that Mum tragically passed away at the end of February whilst on Tagrisso/AZD9291 for about a month. My question really is for gaining some sort of closure. I noticed on another forum and from research that the response rate to tagrisso is 70% for those who are T790m positive and so we really thought it would work for her. When I met her oncologist after she passed away, she said that my mother might have been in the 30% for whom it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t work as the cancer had become aggressive after erlotinib. I just wonder if there have been many cases where patients have been T790m positive but tagrisso hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t worked as all I can find is positive findings. I just wonder if the cancer was allowed the progress and if she had got the drug earlier it would have made a difference? Perhaps more chemotherapy, etc.  The link you posted seems to be more for those who are T790m negative. Advice appreciated, thanks",tagrisso,0,,,
"When I last saw my neurologist, back in April last year, he told me that he saw no sign that my MS was shifting to Secondary Progressive. Since I saw him I've developed foot drop, my walking speed has probably halved and the distance I can walk has plummeted. I don't know what the criteria are for SPMS rather than RRMS but I'm hoping that I don't meet them. I'm happy taking Gilenya and the only DMTs for SPMS are interferon or Mitoxantrone. I can't take interferon because it caused depression when I took it some years ago. Mitoxantrone is most effective for people who have relapses and I don't like the sound of the side effects any way. Gilenya seems to be keeping relapses at bay, apart from one about a year ago, so I don't know how badly I would suffer if I was taken off it. Yes, RRMS and SPMS are just labels, however gently or bluntly they're applied. A label won't make any difference to how we feel or what we can do day-to-day. Where it does make a difference is in the availability of treatments for our condition. So I'm content to say that I have RRMS till my neurologist says otherwise - gently, I hope!",gilenya,2,,,

Her blood work shows high LDH and low albumin.  Is this reason to believe the Crizotinib is not effective? Is it possible that the ROS1 detection was false positive?

"I have been on Remicade for 2 years, and a few months ago I started getting severe joint pain and swelling in my wrists, knees, elbows etc.. The pain and swelling moves around. I called my GI doctor and he had me get bloodwork to check for Remicade antibodies. He called it a Prometheus test. Anyway, he called a couple of weeks later and said everything looked fine and to continue my infusions, but to see a rheumatologist to check out the cause of my joint pain. So I got a referral but can't get in to see a rheumatologist for 6 months. In the meantime my pcp did bloodwork that showed a positive ANA and possibility of lupus. He then sent me for the anti-dsDNA test and it came back positive, suggesting lupus. So I had been hoping that my pain might be caused from the Remicade, but the Prometheus test for antibodies had been negative. So I am really confused. If the Prometheus test shows no antibodies to Remicade, does that mean that I might have full blown lupus and not drug induced lupus? Has anyone had any similar problem?",remicade,1,,,
"As researchers have learned more about the mechanism behind the disease, targeted therapies for patients with EGFR-positive lung cancer have become more widely used. But given the myriad of ways this malignancy can evolve, the treatment landscape is constantly shifting, according to Edward Garon. At the 16 th Annual Winter Lung Cancer Conference in Miami Beach, CURE â€™s sister publication, OncLive , sat down with Garon, who is director of thoracic oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, to discuss the findings of recent clinical studies and how they impact the future use of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. You just spoke about bringing immunotherapy into EGFR mutations. Can you start by discussing what the optimal regimen is for these patients right now? Garon : I think weâ€™re at the point where we donâ€™t have an optimal approach to immunotherapy in this population of patients. One of the things that I addressed in my talk was the dearth of data regarding this population of patients. The strongest data to date, I would argue, is from the IMpower150 study , which had three separate arms: the control arm was the regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel and (Avastin [bevacizumab]), and there were two study arms â€“ one that swapped out the (Avastin) for (Tecentriq [atezolizumab]) and another that was a quadruplet that used all of the drugs: carboplatin, paclitaxel, (Avastin) and (Tecentriq). That study was for patients who had completed their therapy with EGFR inhibitors. What was shown was that the group of patients who received the quadruplet did have a benefit with respect to progression-free survival. And although the hazard ratio did cross one, there was at least a numerical suggestion that there was an overall survival advantage as well in that group of patients. Interestingly, there was not a clear benefit â€“ or at least as clear a benefit â€“ when the (Tecentriq) substituted for the (Avastin), really begging the question whether there was something in particular about the four drugs together. That, I think, to date, is the most compelling data set. It is not part of the approval for this quadruplet regimen, but it is something that we are often able to get to patients based on recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. What are the next steps with that data? I think that data is, what that data is. It was about 100 patients out of a large clinical trial and I donâ€™t know whether or not there is an effort to replicate that in a larger number of patients. I know that some of the other PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are looking at studies of that design, although generally not incorporating the (Avastin). One of the things that is an advantage for the IMpower150 study is that the same company owns both (Avastin) and (Tecentriq), which makes it easier to run that study looking at the quadruplet. Nonetheless there are some biological reasons to imagine that the inclusion of (Avastin) is important in this. We know that, particularly from data out of Japan that, certainly for progression-free survival, the addition of (Avastin) clearly adds to the EGFR inhibitor (Tarceva [erlotinib]) in two studies that have assessed that. We are also awaiting data from a study of (Tarceva) with or without (Cyramza [ramucirumab]). Are there any concerns with toxicity with a four-drug regimen like that? There certainly are concerns with toxicity. If one looks at the IMpower150 study, as one might expect, the toxicity is a little bit worse in the quadruplet than it would be in the triplet. Thatâ€™s in some ways to be expected. One of the other issues, aside from toxicity, is that the backbone of the regimen, carboplatin, paclitaxel and (Avastin) â€“ although a very reasonable, approved regimen for many years now â€“ has lost favor among many practitioners [who instead opt] for carboplatin and pemetrexed. Itâ€™s a little hard to find in the objective data what the reason for that is, because when theyâ€™re compared with respect to efficacy, the outcomes are not particularly disparate. But when you talk to practitioners, they will tell you it is for tolerability. As part of the PointBreak study, tolerability was assessed and one of the interesting things there is that neuropathy was the one toxicity that was clearly different between the two. The other, which frankly, is a big issue in my practice, is the hair loss. Many of my patients are continuing to work and they donâ€™t want to lose their hair. Losing your hair is something that is associated in peopleâ€™s minds with being sick and they donâ€™t like that, so thatâ€™s been another issue. Where do you see this potentially having a role â€“ in later lines of therapy, or earlier on? I think for right now the thought would be to have this after the completion of EGFR-TKI. The data supporting PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors prior to any EGFR-TKI is quite scant, so thatâ€™s where I would foresee it. Now, one thing I would also argue is that Iâ€™m hopeful that this is not the â€œbest it getsâ€ for immunotherapy in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. I think that the toxicity is significant with this regimen and the efficacy, although in the study it certainly looked better than chemotherapy alone, we still hope for better and hopefully weâ€™ll see that in the coming years.",tarceva,2,,,
"Yesterday I went to see the team at the QMC for a follow-up from the recent MOAR (Mother Of All Relapses) and things have certainly changed in the realm of Disease Modifying Therapies. Most noticeably there seems to be a "" failure will not be tolerated "" attitude to treatments. Which is why after my first relapse in 5 years (and first in the almost 2 years since I started taking Tecfidera), the Neurologist and MS Nurses are keen to discuss changing medication, and a step-up from First Line treatments to more aggressively effective Second Line options. So we're now back in the realm of weighing up drugs (or, more likely, sticking a wet finger in the air to see which way the wind blows) - the key contenders are: Finngolimod (aka Gilenya) - one pill a day but the promised reduction in relapse rate means there's not a huge amount to choose between this and Tecfidera - it's still classed as First Line, and - like I've said - the various teams would like to see a move to something a bit more effective. Tysabri (aka Natalizumab) - an intravenous infusion once every four weeks. The MS Nurse described this as acting like velcro on the immune cells in the blood stream, preventing them from passing through blood vessel walls and into the central nervous system where nerve damage occurs. As it says in the MS Trust publication on Disease Modifying Drug s (links opens as a PDF):  Tysabri is a highly effective (category 2.0) DMD; it reduces the number of relapses by about two thirds (70%). Sounds great, yeah? But hang on...  Treatment with Tysabri may increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ), an uncommon brain infection that can lead to severe disability or even death. PML is caused by a mutation of the JC virus , a common infection completely unrelated to MS. So there's that ... And finally Alemtuzumab (aka Lemtrada aka Campath) - taken as two five-day intravenous infusions, 12 months apart. Again, this is a highly effective category 2 DMD, reducing the number of relapses by around 70%. Because Alemtuzumab suppresses the immune system, people are more vulnerable to infections, and there's the usual headaches and nausea. But surely that's not all, right?  Three serious side effects have been reported from clinical trials: overactive or underactive thyroid gland leading to thyroid disorders, affecting 360 in 1000 people idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a serious disorder which prevents blood from clotting, affecting 10 in 1000 people kidney problems, affecting 3 in 1000 people These side effects are potentially serious but they are treatable if caught early enough. People taking Lemtrada will be informed of the early signs and symptoms of these side effects. When I was talking to the MS Nurse, she implied that Alemtuzumab had more risks associated with it (certainly more than the MS Trust publication implies), mostly because of how intense it is, effectively wiping out lymphocytes - more reading will have to be done. So this is where we are! Next week I'm going back to the QMC for a blood test to see if I have the JC Virus and am therefore more or less likely to develop PML. On first glance, I was leaning more towards Tysabri but now I'm not so sure.  Posted by stevedomino at 10:37 am   Email This BlogThis!

"I am sure that evil doctors in bed with pharmaceutical companies makes sensational conspiracy theories or headlines. I think the reality is that's not likely and it's a lot more boring and based on verification and guidelines. As I said biologics aren't first line treatments. I believe patient need, disease severity, and a patient being unresponsive to lesser treatments are a much stronger precursor to being prescribed a biologic. Insurance companies have protocols and procedures to ensure that other medications are tried first. Endoscopes before and after treatment are used as qualifiers, etc. I'm sure there's the occasional bad egg out there (outliers), but the vast majority of doctors have their patients needs at heart. Severe, nonresponsive cases do warrant fast medication escalation. Milder cases do not. NIH (in the UK) is a very different nationally run system that gives individual practices much more overhead and regulations. Newer medications are approved more slowly in the UK than usa (take entyvio as an example). Same goes for newer equipment and procedures. I'd say usa has quicker access to new treatments ideas and processes. The disadvantage is the usa cost, and without thorough vetting some new methodologies may not be any better, just wasteful. The NIH is certainly more cautious. Both systems have pros and cons. However, neither system is full of people with little regard to patient outcomes.

"Hi everyone, I wonder if anyone here has experienced a pretty bad pseudo-relapse and how do you know itâ€™s that? I had 2 very bad relapses in the space of 4 months in 2016 (the second one happened 3 weeks after starting Gilenya).

Iâ€™ve not had a full nightâ€™s sleep since 23rd December â€“ Iâ€™m not sure if this insomnia is caused from the cold or the increased dose of baclofen I started in mid-Dec. Either way the result is I completely lost the use of my right leg yesterday and all the awful nerve pain that comes with that (exactly the same as my last relapse in Sept that I was only recovering from)!

"Patients with untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR m) and with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline were reported to have better CNS progression-free survival (PFS) compared with the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib. CNS PFS was not reached for a certain subset of patients administered osimertinib and was 13.9 months with standard EGFR-TKI therapy ( P = .014) These results from a preplanned, exploratory analysis of the phase 3 FLAURA study â€” the registration study that got osimertinib approved to be used as a first-line therapy in patients with EGFR -mutated advanced NSCLC â€” were reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. 1,2 The FLAURA study was a randomized, double-blind study in patients with untreated EGFR m NSCLC that compared osimertinib with standard EGFR-TKI therapy (gefitinib or erlotinib). 3 Subset Analysis in Patients From FLAURA With CNS Metastases The subset of patients from FLAURA included in the current analyses had documented CNS metastases at baseline as seen in brain scans assessed by a neurologist in a blinded manner. 1  Related Articles PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors May Increase the Risk of Hyperprogressive Disease in NSCLC S-1 Plus Carboplatin May Be Effective in NSCLC Patients With Interstitial Lung Disease Gefitinib Continuation Therapy May Be Effective in NSCLC Post-Progression Of the 200 patients included in the study, data were provided for 128 patients with measurable and/or nonmeasurable CNS metastases on available baseline brain scans (the CNS full-analysis set [cFAS]). Sixty-one patients were treated with osimertinib and 67 with standard EGFR-TKIs. 1 End points that were assessed included CNS PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), CNS duration of response (DOR), CNS disease control rate (DCR), and CNS progression. 1 Median follow-up for CNS PFS was 12.4 months for patients on osimertinib and 7.0 months for patients on standard EGFR-TKIs. While patient characteristics were balanced at baseline, the median sum of baseline CNS tumor lesion size was larger in patients on standard EGFR-TKI (29 vs 16 mm in the osimertinib arm). 1 For the end point of CNS PFS, the difference between the 2 arms was considered nominally statistically significant. CNS progression was seen in approximately twice as many patients on standard EGFR-TKIs (39% vs 20% for osimertinib) and resulted in new CNS lesions in 12% of patients on osimertinib and 30% of patients on standard EGFR-TKIs. 1 CNN ORR was 66% for patients on osimertinib and 43% for patients on standard EGFR-TKIs (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5; P = .011). In 41 patients with at least 1 measurable lesion at baseline (the CNS evaluable for response set [cEFR]; osimertinib, 22 patients; standard EGFR-TKI, 19 patients), CNS ORR was 91% for patients on osimertinib and 68% for patients on standard EGFR-TKIs (OR: 4.6; P = .066). 1 In the CNS evaluable-for-response set (cEFR) population, median time to response was 6 weeks for each of the 2 groups. However, median CNS DOR was longer for patients receiving EGFR-TKIs compared with osimertinib (18.7 vs 15.2 months, respectively). Also in this population, CNS DCR was similar across the 2 groups (95% for osimertinib and 89% for EGFR-TKIs; P = .462). 1 The study authors noted that taken together with data reported from FLAURA, these data indicate that in the subgroup of patients without known or treated CNS metastases at baseline, osimertinib provides a protective effect against the development of brain metastases. 1",osimertinib,2,,,

"â€“ Prolonged corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was associated with a significantly increased mortality risk compared with antiâ€“tumor necrosis factor therapy in a landmark study spotlighted by Edward V. Loftus Jr., MD, at the Gastroenterology Updates, IBD, Liver Disease meeting. This was one of several key studies on safety issues involving IBD medications published in the past year. Others highlighted by Dr. Loftus and copanelist William J. Sandborn, MD, included a study that provided persuasive evidence that TNF inhibitors modestly increase lymphoma risk in IBD patients to a degree similar to that of thiopurines, and several reports addressing the question of whether preoperative use of vedolizumab in patients undergoing major abdominal operations for IBD boosts postoperative infection risk.  Mortality impact of prolonged steroids vs. anti-TNF therapy   Bruce Jancin/MDedge News Dr. Edward V. Loftus Jr. (left) and Dr. William J. Sandborn A retrospective cohort study of more than 13,000 Medicare and Medicaid patients with IBD demonstrated that those on prolonged corticosteroid therapy â€“ defined as more than 3,000 mg of prednisone or its equivalent in a 12-month period â€“ had a significantly higher mortality rate compared with IBD patients on an anti-TNF agent. That will come as an unpleasant surprise to many physicians. There is a widespread reluctance to turn to continuous chronic immunosuppression via anti-TNF therapy in patients with challenging IBD, particularly in elderly individuals with multiple comorbid conditions. Many physicians have heard and read so much about the biologicsâ€™ risks of serious adverse events that they opt instead for multiple courses of corticosteroids for disease control. This is a serious mistake, emphasized Dr. Loftus, professor of medicine and director of the IBD Interest Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. â€œWhen you say, â€˜Oh, Iâ€™ll just give that patient another prednisone taper, he doesnâ€™t want to start taking a TNF inhibitor,â€™ youâ€™re actually doing the patient harm. Youâ€™re actually affecting the patientâ€™s life expectancy when you do that,â€ he declared. â€œThe message is, yes, steroids are cheap, steroids are easy, nobodyâ€™s afraid of steroids, but you should be afraid of steroids.â€ The 1,879 Crohnâ€™s disease patients who entered the cohort as new users of anti-TNF therapy had a subsequent mortality incidence rate of 21.4 per 1,000 person-years, compared with a rate of 30.1 per 1,000 person-years in the 7,694 who entered the study period as prolonged steroid users. In a multivariate analysis accounting for 57 potential confounding factors, this translated to a highly significant 22% relative risk reduction in mortality in the patients who went with anti-TNF therapy (Am J Gastroenterol. 2018 Jan 16.  doi: 10.1038/ajg.2017.479 ). A similar trend was seen in the ulcerative colitis cohort. The 459 ulcerative colitis patients who entered the cohort as new anti-TNF therapy users had a mortality incidence rate of 23.0 per 1,000 person-years, compared with a rate of 30.9 in the 3,224 who received more than 3,000 mg of prednisone in the next 12 months. This represented a 14% relative risk reduction, although this favorable trend did not achieve statistical significance, perhaps because of the smaller size of the ulcerative colitis cohort.",vedolizumab,1,,,

"December 7, 2018 Immunotherapy and TNBC: The Beginning of the Beginning As immunotherapy has emerged as an important approach to treating a range of cancers, researchers have been increasingly interested in TNBC as a potential target for these agents. TNBC is an immunogenic cancer. That means that the tumor is more likely to generate an immune response to the cancer. Tumors that are immunogenic usually:  Have multiple mutations Have cells called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in them TNBC meets these criteria. The first study to note a possible role for immunotherapy in TNBC was the KEYNOTE trial published in June, 2017. That study found that a single agent, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) produced an intriguing response in TNBC patients who had been heavily treated with chemotherapy. While the numbers were small, several of the these very advanced patients had responses that continued for months or even years. That study opened the doors to many trials looking at different aspects of immunotherapy for TNBC. In October 2018, the IMPASSION study showed a significant response to a combination of an immunotherapy agent and chemotherapy as first line therapy in patients with metastatic or non-surgically treatable TNBC. There are now studies looking at combinations of immunotherapy with PARP inhibitors or chemotherapy, studies investigating which patients are most likely to benefit and when in the course of treatment, immunotherapy is most effective. There are also a number of new immunotherapy agents in trials. Two of these studies were highlighted at SABCS 2018: The first is a scientifically complex study aimed at determining which patients will have the highest response rates to an immunotherapy agent known as atezolizumab, the same agent in the IMPASSION study. That trial showed patients with a marker called PD-L1 benefit from treatment with atezolizumab. This will help researchers both design future trials and personalize treatment for TNBC patients. The second study is a phase I trial of CAR-T therapy for patients that have a specific targetable mutation, including TNBC patients. CAR-T is a technically complex form of treatment in which cells are removed from the patient, genetically re-engineered and then injected back into the patient where the goal is to stimulate an ongoing immune response to the tumor. It has been used in clinical trials with patients who have a range of leukemias, lymphomas, non small cell lung cancer and other tumors, but this is the first trial to include TNBC patients. This is a phase I study with small numbers of patients and very early results.

"Although interferon beta-1a (IFNÃŸâˆ’1a), 1b (IFNÃŸâˆ’1b), and fingolimod have been approved as multiple sclerosis (MS) treatments, they have not yet been included on the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) formulary in Thailand. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of MS treatments compared with best supportive care (BSC) based on a societal perspective in Thailand.  Methods: A Markov model with cost and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon with a 1-month cycle length was conducted for relapsingâ€“remitting MS (RRMS) patients. Cost and outcome data were obtained from published studies, collected from major MS clinics in Thailand and a discount rate of 3 percent was applied. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results: When compared with BSC, the ICERs for patients with RRMS aged 35 years receiving fingolimod, IFNÎ²âˆ’1b, and IFNÎ²âˆ’1a were 33,000, 12,000, and 42,000 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. At the Thai societal willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of USD 4,500 per QALY gained, BSC had the highest probability of being cost-effective (49 percent), whereas IFNÎ²âˆ’1b and fingolimod treatments showed lower chance being cost-effective at 25 percent and 18 percent, respectively.  Conclusions: Compared with fingolimod and interferon treatments, BSC remains to be the most cost-effective treatment for RRMS in Thailand based on a WTP threshold of USD 4,500 per QALY gained. The results do not support the inclusion of fingolimod or interferon in the NLEM for the treatment of RRMS unless their prices are decreased or special schema arranged.",fingolimod,2,,,

"My name is Charles, I had been diagnosed with stage 3b NSCLC and a brochoscopy w/biopsy confirmed. A pet scan also confirmed a tumor 13 cm x 8cm in my right lung with suspected partial lung collapse. went through 35 radiation treatments and 10 chemo infusions with taxol and carboplatin with relatively no side effects until after treatments were through. lungs continue to make excess mucous and inflammation 1 month and 8 days after treatment stopped. had initial ct scan after treatment and scan showed tumor at least 50% smaller (7cm) but they don't know exactly how much smaller because a lot of what is seen on the scan is suspected to be inflammation and/or dying tissue.so shrinkage could be exceptionally more than 50%. continued to cough up and expel less and less matter and pinkish to red mucus until today. coughing continues to improve slowly and lungs appear to feel like they are healing. I am scheduled to start immunotherapy (durvalumab) tomorrow Jan. 22 and I am very anxious and nervous. The difference between my whirlwind with cancer and others on immunotherapy blogs, mainly durvalumab blogs seems to be that I am trying to be more proactive in my plan than others seem to be in theirs, I could be wrong though. I had to disqualify my first radiation doctor after the consultation because he did not fit the criteria in my treatment expectations. He seemed to be too complacent and non-chalant about my case without even seeing my scans and seemed to want to put the radiation part of my treatment off until after chemo, which research has shown that chemo and radiation concurrently killed tumors better than consecutive treatments in my type of cancer, boy I'm glad I did my research on that one because that part has been a success as far as tumor shrinkage goes. Also, since I am a part of my own treatment, anything I can do to help the treatments, I feel I am doing, like trying to eat more healthy foods like fresh vegetables as close to raw as I can stand them and maintaining my bodily ph levels at 8.0 to 8.5 (due to my research and beliefs) with the help of ph test strips, during chemo and radiation. and will continue to keep ph from 7.5 to 8.0 during immuno. all with the blessings of my onc dr., primary care provider, and radiation dr. So far, by indications and research all has gone very well. I haven't read anywhere that a 13x8 cm tumor was shrunk so much, so I have to believe that my contributions to the medical treatments have worked hand in hand. And one of the biggest factors of it all is GOD! I have prayed for God's help and presence in all this and know at the time of his works that he is here with me and the direct cause of the miracle at hand. I consider my decision to help with my treatments a part of his miracles. I am nervously awaiting the time for my initial pet scan after treatments and hope that my immuno goes well. I know that durvalumab is not given with curative intents but in my eyes it cannot hurt but my goal is curative. I this comment is long winded, which I hope I will be when this whirlwind subsides and I hope this is the correct place to air my comments as I have never had to comment in this way before. I will try to monitor and post as the immuno and pet scans progress and answer ones who reply if any, Thanxm Charlie..",durvalumab,2,,,
"Hi Hardwaller, Like you I am in a similar situation. My partner was diagnosed 6 years ago, last 2 years her cognitive abilities have decreased significantly to the point where a conversation that lasts more than 3 mins ultimately ends up in a loop of repetition, struggles with words, and for the last 6 months has had issues with her eyes to the point where she can no longer read and struggles to make out people's face in photographs. Like your wife, my partner doesn't let it bother her (within the family unit/home), according to the Neuro sufferers don't actually realise they have a problem. She does accept that she has a small problem with her memory god bless her. She does find going out quite hard as she's afraid people will find her ""stupid"" which is very heartbreaking as she used to be fiercely independent.

"Likewise, welcome back (kind of !). That's the trouble with MS, you manage to ignore it for a while and start to think maybe it's given up on you! Then it sticks it's ugly little head up and tells you 'woohoo I'm still here'! Chances are that if you've had symptoms of late that you have got activity showing on the MRI. The neurologist probably wouldn't trouble you over the MRI results because it's entirely possible to have new MS activity without actual relapses or symptoms. So there's no value in worrying a person unless they have relapse symptoms. Good news that you've got an appointment fairly quickly, I guess with an MS nurse initially as you say they've shifted your neuro appointment too. There are lots of DMDs that you can now get that just weren't available in 2007. If you do a bit of thinking and research before your appointment then you can at least have an idea of what you'd prefer to get if it's available to you (ie. postcode lottery allowing!). Tecfidera is obviously an easy one that should be available, but you might be able to get Tysabri as well given that you've already 'failed' on a first line drug. Or of course there's Gilenya, or a beta-interferon (although as you've had ISR problems in the past that may not be a good option for you). And then there's the heavy duty drugs, Lemtrada and the like, but you may feel that you would have to have had very active relapses to risk the side effects. I can't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to take any DMD whilst doing shift work. Best of luck with your appointment. Sue",gilenya,1,,,

It is very distressing and overwhelming, but please stay focus,learn everything about the disease and have good communication with your healthcare team. My son was with 6MP and Allopurinol for many years and that worked for him, but his Dr. stopped this combination. She started him on another medication and that was not good for his liver. She kept him only with Lialda and we were hoping he was not going to have another flare. He did about a month ago. He went back to the dr. and this time the dr said he needed to start Remicade. We never allowed the biologics when he was younger and now he also refuses it. He was determined to get better without the biologics and he remembered about the specific carbohydrate diet. (SCD diet). . I cook for him, make the scd yougurt twice a week , and bake almond bread. I am familiar with this diet because i found in 2007 and we tried but it was hard for him becuase he loved all the bad food... candy, pizza, hamburgers, fries , etc...He is now doing very well on the diet. I see his improvement and the bleeding stopped and he now has formed stools.I know what a bad chrons flare is because he was in the hospital for a week when he was 9 years old.

"â€œLive in the Light of My Presence, and your light will shine brightly into the lives of others.â€ â€” Sarah Young from Jesus Calling   OK â€“ itâ€™s not the March Madness you sports fans care about â€¦ but itâ€™s my personal March Madness, and it has definitely begun!!  Getting March Off the Ground  The month kicked off on March 2 with a CT scan in the morning and chemo in the afternoon. In the midst of recovering, on Sunday, March 4, Tim and I flew to Denver. Tim had a conference there (SWANApalooza, if you want to know ðŸ™‚ ), so I tagged along for a few days â€” the perfect opportunity to meet Dr. Camidge. (More on that below!). I am not a seasoned traveler and stupidly carried heavy stuff on the plane (and across the airport in a mad rush coming home), so I learned something from that experience for sure! On Monday, Dr. Kim called us to give us the results of the CT scan. His exact words were â€œstable, stable, stable!â€ (YAY!) So that means I keep on keeping on with the Alimta (chemo) every four weeks. My next scan will be in June. After our phone call, I had lunch with one of my best friends growing up (Trista). I just now realized that that we spent so much time talking and catching up (almost 4 hours), that I didnâ€™t even take a picture with her . What. the. heck.? It was a once-in-10-years moment and I didnâ€™t capture it in a photo! I guess I just was so excited to see her and talk to her and catch up that a picture didnâ€™t even cross my mind. Very odd for me. Jeepers! (On that same note, on Friday I also forgot to take a chemo picture for the first time â€¦ I think I just have so much going on that the living part is taking over the documenting part.)(Which is a good thing!!!) But, maybe I should hire paparazzi to follow me around this month and capture the month in pictures. When I got back to the hotel from â€œlunch,â€ I pretty much went to bed and didnâ€™t wake up until the next morning. I was wiped out from the chemo on Friday, the travel on Sunday, the long lunch, the time change, whatever. But I did feel much better on Tuesday!   On Tuesday, we had our appointment with Dr. Ross Camidge, who you may remember if you have been following me or if you are a ROS1der, is one of the top ROS1+ experts in the world. He works at the University of Colorado Anschutz Cancer Pavilion. Tim and I have talked to him on the phone twice when we had big decisions to make and we wanted to get his opinion, so he knows us somewhat. But I wanted to actually have a face-to-face meeting with him at least once and this was a great opportunity. I really didnâ€™t have many questions for him and he didnâ€™t have much for me since he had my scans and knows Iâ€™m stable, so we just chatted for a little bit, I got my few questions answered, and then I headed for the airport for another full day of traveling. This time by myself as Tim was staying for the conference.  Second Birthday Celebration  My second celebration (the first one was Punta Cana) was this past weekend and was a very relaxing casual time in Bluffton, SC, where our friends Mitch and Jill moved about a year ago. Sheryl and Greg joined us and we just hung out together. It was really nice and stress-free! Saturday was really the only day we had, so the girls went to Old Town Bluffton to walk around and have brunch. Then we took a pontoon boat around the lake that their neighborhood is built around. That was fun! We got back to the house and I took a nice short two-hour nap ðŸ™‚ before we went out to dinner. All-in-all, it was awesome to see Mitch and Jill (always) and it was a nice relaxing weekend in the midst of all the craziness of this month!

"Dorothy, My mom has been on Keytruda for a year. She began with Carbo + Alimta + Keytruda for 6 sessions and then went to Keytruda only. We've learned quite a bit along the way. As far as thyroid - it needs to be monitored regularly - my mom has her TSH tested every 3 weeks when she receives her infusion. Her free T4 is tested about every 4 or so months. Thyroid issues is a very common side effect, so if they aren't monitoring it already, they should be. My mom's docs don't bring it up at her regular visits unless there is something wrong and she needs to change her meds. So maybe docs are testing thyroid, but just not giving you the info???? As far as muscle pain, my mom doesn't have any but it's not all that uncommon. I've not heard that it is severe enough that it causes someone to limp. I also haven't heard about tendon pain. Immunotherapy does cause inflammation, even in joints so it could be related to the immunotherapy. But I don't think that will explain the redness on the skin. So, I agree with Tom, you should contact his docs and report the symptoms. He may have some sort of unrelated infection that needs to be addressed asap.

"FEBRUARY 19, 2016 There is finally some progress in the hunt for a treatment for the most difficult form of multiple sclerosis â€” the form that has stubbornly resisted every attempt to find a therapy. The catch, experts say, is that people with this form of the disease should keep their expectations low, because even the new drug thatâ€™s now in the last stages of development doesnâ€™t appear to have a big clinical impact. The reason that the new drug is generating so much interest, though, is that itâ€™s the first time a therapy for primary progressive MS has had any impact at all. And itâ€™s the first MS drug to ever receive a â€œbreakthroughâ€ designation from the Food and Drug Administration, which puts the experimental medicine on a fast track to get through the review process as quickly as possible. The agency granted the designation earlier this week. Read more: Father, daughter fight different forms of MS Primary progressive MS is a relatively rare form of the neurological disease in which a person doesnâ€™t have severe attacks, the way people do with the more common, relapsing-remitting kind. Instead, they suffer a slow, steady physical deterioration with no hope of recovery. The FDA has approved 13 drugs for treating relapsing-remitting MS, but none have been shown to work for people with primary progressive disease. The new â€œbreakthroughâ€ drug, called ocrelizumab, is one of six that are in various stages of development for this recalcitrant form, one that affects 10 to 15 percent of the estimated 400,000 Americans living with MS. On Friday, the company behind ocrelizumab, the Roche subsidiary Genentech, will release new Phase 3 trial data at a conference of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which is being held in New Orleans. Genentech has already published a first round of the results, which showed some impact on a wide range of measures for people with primary progressive MS. The new data will include more detail on how ocrelizumab affected subgroups of patients, as well as new information on how it worked in people with relapsing-remitting MS, to show whether it can also work on the more common variety of the disease.

"I do have a silicone lubricant bubble in my eye, Randy. After much research of my own, I think I have learned more about this issue. Apparently there are various types of syringes. Avastin typically, in the US anyway, comes in ""steak-on"" (or ""steaked-on"") syringes, whereas Eylea typically comes in ""Luer Lock"" syringes. The largest manufacturer of all the various types of syringes in the US uses silicone lubricant on ALL of them. The syringe itself is what makes the chances of getting silicone into the patient's eye different. On the Luer-Lock syringes the lubricant has far less likelihood of getting onto the needle itself than with the ""steak-on"" type. I am switching from Avastin to Eylea for my next inj.

"Hello, My name is Patrick. I am a 25 year-old data scientist based in Dubai and I have MS and I am gay. I was diagnosed with MS when I was 19 andI have been on Gilenya since this diagnosis. So far, I have found considerable relief with this drug. However, I come from a very conservative Irish family. My father was always very hard on me when growing up as I was flamboyant. I was not the ""normal"" child he wanted apparently but a freak. I also never liked how he used to release his temper onto my mother and the bigoted mindset he exerted. Hence, I always made it my business not to have a relationship with him going up. In my first year of university, mainly due to my incredibly sheltered upbringing and being still closeted, I was bullied mercilessly by my 7 housemates. It culminated with me nearly assaulted. I subsequently had to take the next year out for an anxiety condition. I am thankful this occurred for 2 reasons - I gained the courage came out as gay and I was diagnosed with MS (my GP, at a regular appointment, noticed one eye blinked slower than the other and sent me to a neurologist and I was diagnosed). I then returned to university, and got my degree. Upon graduating, I joined a consultancy firm which I stayed for 16 months with. Even though I spent a year in America with them, it was a very homophobic environment and i even got slapped by a colleague outside a work event. I never went to HR out of fear nor did I tell my family. I now work in Dubai with a very LGBT-inclusive firm (yes, I understand the irony - LGBT in Dubai, however, I am mainly working with Americans) Now, up until June this hear, I was dependent on my father to send me my medication. I should say he threw me out of the house last Christmas eve in one of his anger fits, which I never got a proper apology for. However, the worse part came last June when I was leaving ireland back to Dubai on my last visit home. He corned me in the hallway of his house and menacingly said in a low-breather ""You are lucky I no longer control - I would not let you g at all. Yes, I no - the words appear benign ... but it is the sentiment of wanting to control my life which scared me. I know he hates the fact I am actively gay. He wants to know everything to which he would spout his emotional/ psychological rhetoric which I grew up with. I put it this way - my eldest sister (hi favorite) took 2 years to tell him about her first boyfriend as he is so Catholic about relations before marriage. Just to get an optic on his ""conservatism"". On arriving back to Dubai, I subsequently appeared to experience frequent anxiety attacks upon my return to Dubai. But worse - first time since my diagnosis with MS, I begun experiencing serious MS symptoms. I doubt the anxiety and the MS are mutually-exclusive in his case. When I emailed my neurologist, she said it was normal and it is OK as my last MRI said I was stable. But I was told that result ... I should say, I see my neurologist every 6 months, with an annual MRII. Up until then, I always thought I never received my MRI reports in the post as they only sent them out if a patient has bad news. Yes, I know - I was a fool. Upon investigation, I discovered my father was opening my medical post and subsequently destroying them - not notifying me of the results  To make matters worse, a few days after this discovery in July, he decided to begin charging me for my Gilenya pos and asking for a little extra too. Now, I know - one would pay back postage expenses to a helpful parent. But if a domineering man, with a violent temper, who is doing all this duplicitous stuff. I do n't think so! I thankfully got a enough supply from a friend who was in Ireland last month, so I have enough until my next appointment. What advice would you give someone in my situation with a difficult, overbearing, homophobic parent who has been very vocal that he has zero faith on my career, about his homophobia,, etc. and has cause of so much sorrow me with all this behaviour? Should I mention it to my neurologist at my next appointment? I never spoke to a medical professional about one situation before for fear as my father is very manipulative. He appears a saint in public, a demon behind doors. He would threaten me when with just me, deny it if I told any of my siblings. I often hear my mother tell others, when she thinks i am not listening - ""Mike (my father) treats Patrick very badly as he him being gay"" ... yet she would never tell someone with power out of fear. I would appreciate any advice you may give and I apologise if I went on a rant. I admire your work with this website greatly. You are making a difference! Kind regards, Patrick",gilenya,0,,,

"Case study: increasing use of infliximab biosimilar could lower costs up to $465 million annually San Francisco, CA /PRNewswire/ - A new study released today by the Pacific Research Institute found that, by removing barriers holding back the increased use of biosimilars, savings could be significant. In a case study of infliximab, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and other illnesses, reforms could realize an annual savings of between $412 million and $465 million. Click here to download a copy of the study. ""Americans have saved a lot on prescription drug costs through the increased use of lower-cost generic medications,"" said Dr. Wayne Winegarden, author of the new study. ""As the next generation of treatments are developed, government and market barriers must not stand in the way of using cheaper biosimilars for more biologically-complex treatments. My study found that we could save significantly if barriers were lifted and biosimilars were used more often."" Biosimilar medicines are lower-cost alternatives for patients and providers. Unlike generic medications, which are chemically identical to the original product, the size and complexity of the biologic molecules make it impossible to make an identical biological molecule. Winegarden noted that greater use of biosimilars had the potential to reduce costs for these treatments in the same way the increased use of generic medications has. Reforms enacted in federal law in 1984 reduced excessive regulatory burdens for generic drug manufacturers, while extending terms and clarifying rights for patent holders. Generics saved the U.S. health system $1.67 trillion between 2007 and 2016 alone. Biologic medications aren't as commonly used but have significant potential. It is estimated that the global market will grow from $46 billion in 2002 to $390 billion by 2020. One industry estimate projects that increasing biosimilar use should cut prices by around 30 percent. In ""Impediments to a Stronger Biosimilars Market,"" Winegarden uses the case study of biosimilars for infliximab, commonly known as Remicade (used to fight rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic severe plaque psoriasis, and active psoriatic arthritis) to show that increasing the use of biosimilars can benefit patients, employers, and taxpayers. Among his findings:  Annual per patient savings between Remicade and the biosimilar would range between $2100 and $4400. If biosimilars grew to become one-half of the infliximab market, annual cost reductions for employer-sponsored health plans would be as high as 8.4 percent, or between $262 million and $315 million less. Savings to taxpayers through lower Medicare costs from utilizing biosimilars could be as high as 8.1 percent, or $150 million in savings annually. Collectively, there could be savings of between $412 million and $465 million a year â€“ just for increasing the use of biosimilars for one drug alone.

"Home Â» MS Information Â» Publications Â» MS Research Update 2018 Â» Siponimod (BAF312)  Siponimod (BAF312)  In this Update Main Article Introduction FDA-Approved Medications Experimental Medications New Directions in MS Research Closing Notes Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies for MS (PDF) References Experimental Medications: New S1P Receptor Modulators Company: Novartis  Oral medication studied at several doses Being studied in SPMS Previous: Ublituximab | Next: Ozanimod Siponimod is a drug with a mechanism of action similar to Gilenya. Like Gilenya, it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does â€“ with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors. Siponimod has a relatively short half-life compared to Gilenya, which means that the drug does not stay in the body as long. Researchers hope that these small differences will minimize cardiac issues. EXPAND, a Phase III, multi-national study of siponimod involving more than 1,600 people with secondary-progressive MS, was published in The Lancet in March 2018. The participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive siponimod or placebo. The trial was scheduled to run for three years or until a pre-specified number of confirmed disability progression events (CDP) occurred. The primary endpoint was time to three-month CDP. 1 The study found that, relative to placebo, siponimod reduced the risk of three-month CDP by 21 percent, cut the risk of six-month CDP by 26 percent, slowed the rate of brain volume loss by 23 percent, and reduced the annual relapse rate by 55 percent. No significant difference was found between siponimod and placebo in terms of two walking tests studied in the trial. Eighteen percent of patients in the siponimod group and 15 percent of those receiving placebo experienced serious adverse events. A decrease in white blood cells, heart rate, and rhythm abnormalities, as well as hypertension, swelling of the macula of the eye, varicella zoster reactivation, and convulsions occurred more often in patients receiving siponimod than in those in the placebo group. The rate of infections, cancer, and death did not differ between the groups, and adjusting the initial dose of siponimod mitigated cardiac effects seen in early treatment with the medication. 1 Novartis, which is developing siponimod, announced that it will file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA in 2018, seeking approval for use of the S1P receptor modulator in SPMS. In RRMS, meanwhile, results from a Phase II dose-finding study of siponimod were first reported in 2012. The trial had a complex design, with the primary goal to determine the most appropriate dose to carry forward into future trials. Approximately 300 people participated in the study. At six months, the proportion of relapse-free patients was 84 percent for the 10-mg group, 92 percent for the 2-mg group, and 77 percent for the 0.5-mg group, as compared to 72 percent in the placebo group. After six months, the ARR (annualized relapse rate) was lower for the individuals who were taking one of the three higher doses. Additionally, regarding MRI parameters, the 2 mg dose reached statistical significance versus placebo, with a reduction in active lesions of approximately 80 percent.

"Dear Members and Staff, My sister, age 49, was diagnosed with NSCLC, stage IV, adenocarcinom, EGFR -mutation, exon 21(L858R), 4 years ago. She was on Tarceva for a little less than a year, followed by chemotherapy (carboplatin+ alimta). When she developed T790-mutation, she did very well on Tagrisso for over a year. However, this summer, her general well-being has  declined and X-rays show tumour progression.  A new biopsy of the main tumour has revealed that her tumour has transformed into squamous lung cancer. According to the mutational analysis, the tumour has the following markers: P40, CK7 positive and PD-L1-negative. Her oncologist is now suggesting a second round of chemotherapy(carboplatin and gemzar).  We would very much appreciate any suggestions regarding further treatment that my sister could have. Please note that we live in Europe/Sweden. Would it be a good idea to add  cetuximab to the chemotherapy, considering she has been diagnosed with squamous lung cancer?  Are you aware of any clinical trials that could be suitable for her case? I saw an article about LY3143921, phase 1 â€“ trial  in UK.  Your advice would be highly appreciated.

"Hi, My question is about my brother. his history Diagnosed NSCLC Adeno with ALK+ and started cisplatin + Alimta and then Alimta maintenance had a very good response and then disease progress. Started Xalkori and after a year, it stops working and again went back to Alimta for few months but after progression he has started Zykadia, it works very well from last 7 months as his lymph nodes disappear and tumour of one lung turns into scar and left lung tumour reduced in size, but as soon as he got report he had a bad rash (last couple of weeks)on his face and body and then he stop taking Zykadia and dermatologist gave him medicine for rashes but suddenly he had a swear headache And by taking Dexa it gets normal, now he had CT scan report just today and it says There is a 41* 34 mm hyperdense lesion with areas of punctate calcification in a target like fashion within the right parietal/temporal lobe. Lesion is demonstrating intense post contrast enhancement and extensive vasogenic oedema. This is causing effacement of ipsilateral lateral ventricle and subfalcine herniation along with mid line shift. No other pathological brainparenchymal lesion is identified. Foreman Magnum and basal cisterns are capacious without any evidence of transtentorial herniation. Conclusion. Imaging features are in keeping with metastic deposit within the right parietal/temporal lobe. Whole brain radiations suggested. My Questions 1. We are scared of radiations, do we have  Cyberknife in option? Or Gammaknife? Which option should be the best? 2. He shouldnâ€™t stop taking Zykadia or not? Or if he needs to stop Zykadia then is it for few days till radiation or he has to stop Zykadia and jump to Nivolumab? As his Zykadia results were better except this brain lesions? 3. If he need to carry on with Zykadia then what he should do to avoid brain lesions as Zykadia doesnâ€™t cross brain barriers. 4. Can he get Alimta once every three months as Alimta cross brain barriers. Sorry if my questions sounds",nivolumab,2,,,

"[continued] Dr. West also expresses doubt about the efficacy of first and second generation TKIs after Tagrisso failures here.  If there are no actionable mutations shown, then the primary options would most likely be standard chemotherapy regimens, to which EGFR mutation positive patients tend to respond well.

There are MANY vendors doing testing, ranging from Guardant Health to Biocept to Foundation Medicine and others. Because the real issue here is really primarily whether he has a T790M mutation or not, it might make the most sense to look at a lab that will do just that for a few hundred (I think Biocept does individual tests as a cost-effective option, for instance, but there are others) rather than doing a long list of tests for thousands of dollars.

I would be reluctant to use it without a solid justification. Our motto is, â€œfirst do no harmâ€.  I suggest sending pleural fluid, or tumor tissue for EGFR. It does not require much tissue to do this test. As Janine points out, SBXRT is a reasonable option for single sites of progression.

"Meeting Coverage  Registry Data: Lemtrada More Effective than Competing MS Tx Better than fingolimod or interferon; comparable to natalizumab by John Gever Managing Editor, MedPage Today LONDON -- Data from a large multiple sclerosis patient registry suggest that alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is more effective in key efficacy measures than two other common drugs for MS and similar in efficacy to a third, a researcher said here. In an analysis covering some 4,500 patients who had recently started alemtuzumab, fingolimod (Gilenya), interferon-beta-1a (Rebif, Avonex), or natalizumab (Tysabri), alemtuzumab was better than fingolimod and interferon for at least one of the following outcome measures: relapse risk, disability progression, or functional improvement, and was not less effective on any efficacy measure, reported Tomas Kalincik, MD, PhD, of the University of Melbourne in Australia. And alemtuzumab and natalizumab were in a virtual dead heat for relapse prevention and reducing disability progression, Kalincik told attendees at an oral late-breaker session during the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis annual meeting. There was only one outcome analyzed in the entire study for which alemtuzumab was inferior to another drug: natalizumab was more likely to produce an improvement in functional ability during the first year of treatment, though not in subsequent years. However, the study, which was not specifically supported by any one drugmaker, had important limitations: it did not address safety at all, and the efficacy outcomes analyzed did not include effects on MRI-detected brain lesions. Nevertheless, Robert Fox, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved with the analysis, said the data were important for informing clinicians about the real-world experience with these agents. This type of analysis, he told MedPage Today, ""allows us to compare drugs head-to-head that weren't compared in head to head trials, and probably won't be."" No major surprises were evident in the results, Fox said. Still, the data provide ""more confidence about the emerging picture of alemtuzumab,"" which only gained approval less than 2 years ago. He also pointed to a significant strength of the analysis: its use of propensity matching to make the observational study more of an ""apples to apples"" comparison, as he put it. For the study Kalincik and colleagues drew on the MSbase database that currently includes some 41,000 MS patients in 35 countries treated for a cumulative 210,000 patient-years. Out of those, the researchers focused on 189 patients treated with alemtuzumab, 2,155 receiving interferon-beta-1a, 828 treated with fingolimod, and 1,160 treated with natalizumab. To be included, patients had to meet the following criteria: ~Definite MS by standard diagnostic criteria ~New treatment with one of the four agents ~Baseline scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale of no more than 5.5 ~Age â‰¤65 ~MS duration of <10 years ~At least one relapse in the past year ~At least 12 months of data prior to starting the drug, and at least 6 months of post-initiation follow-up ~Minimum of two post-baseline visits at least 6 months apart Patients were also selected so that they could be matched with others with different treatment types according to clinical and demographic data (propensity matching). Highlights of the comparisons cited by Kalincik were: ~Alemtuzumab vs interferon: superior for mitigating relapse activity and, in patients with highly active disease, disability progression; and improving functional ability ~Alemtuzumab vs fingolimod: superior for preventing relapses, otherwise comparable ~Alemtuzumab vs natalizumab: comparable for relapse activity and disability progression, natalizumab superior for early regression of disability Kalincik said his group also performed numerous sensitivity analyses in which various parameters, such as definitions of pre-baseline disease activity, or specifying a different minimum follow-up interval, were altered. There was no important change in the overall results, he said. _______________________ Kalincik disclosed relevant relationships with Roche, Genzyme, Novartis, Merck KGaA, Biogen, WebMD Global, Sanofi-Genzyme, Teva, and BioCSL.

"Hi JimC, thank you for your quick response. My fatherâ€™s oncologist did suggested chemo but unfortunately he couldnâ€™t tolerate it after the first(low dose) infusion so chemo is clearly out of the question for now. He did received radiation treatments to the bones but itâ€™s pretty clear that he is having new bone mets after the radiation treatments. I also brought up the idea about the possibility for the combination of two different EGFR TKI, but his oncologistâ€™s response was they wonâ€™t do that outside of a clinical trial and she seems to think even that probably wonâ€™t help much other than just adding more toxic to the patientâ€™s body and going back to Tarceva is not going to help either, now this is where Iâ€™m not so sure I agree 100% with her. I can totally understand the combination might not work at all, but I just couldnâ€™t agree on giving up something especially someoneâ€™s life without even giving it a try.

"Just a quick update.   Mom had both an onc appointment and an infusion appointment.  The onc recommended mom stay on the Alimta as she has been responding to Alimta well since diagnosis.

"Hi Emily, Itâ€™s good to hear of your husbandâ€™s response to WBR and pulsed Tarceva. Itâ€™s hard to know which of these approaches caused his improvement, although if there was a scan after a period of pulsed Tarceva but before the WBR, that might provide a clue.  There was a good discussion of radiation, pulsed Tarceva and intrathecal chemo here.None of the faculty members in that thread endorsed intrathecal chemo for LMC in lung cancer (where it doesnâ€™t tend to work nearly as well as in breast cancer LMC cases), It should also be noted that it tends to be especially difficult to tolerate. Dr. West concluded his remarks with: â€œI am not especially fearful about the negative side effects of WBRT, but Iâ€™m also not wildly optimistic about its likelihood of helping.  I do at least feel that itâ€™s less intensive than intrathecal chemotherapy, so I might consider it a very fair option in a patient who isnâ€™t declining from week to week.  If it appeared that things were worsening very readily, I believe Iâ€™d prioritize comfort and be inclined to minimize interventions.â€ Given the possibility that pulsed Tarceva is driving your husbandâ€™s improvement, together with the general lack of enthusiasm for intrathecal chemo, it seems that continuing pulsed Tarceva may be a reasonable option.

Introduction: Quick Poll Methodology and Respondentsâ€™ Geographic Distribution 2011 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting was held in Chicago, IL. June 3-7, 2011 Melanoma Quick Poll was launched by email on the morning of Friday, June 10, 2011 4th in a series of 4 ASCO Quick Polls: Other Quick-Polls include Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GU (prostate and renal) cancers, GI cancers, and Melanoma Sent to global distribution of Medical Oncologists and clinicians with a clinical interest in Melanoma Data taken on June 15 th with 201 complete responses ~1/2 of responses from USA Responses received from 23 different countries in total No financial incentives provided for participation  Survey Results: 1) Melanoma Treaters Plan to Treat a Majority of Their V600E BRAF + Melanoma Patients with Vemurafenib  Conclusions US melanoma treaters have slightly higher anticipated usage of vemurafenib A majority will place 81-100% of their stage III and stage IV melanoma patients on vemurafenib Ex-US melanoma treaters more likely to place stage IV melanoma patients on vemurafenib than stage III unresectable melanoma patients ~50% will place 81-100% of their stage IV melanoma patients as opposed to 33% for their stage III patients  2) Physicians Plan Selective Usage of Ipilimumab in Their Advanced and Metastatic Melanoma Patients with Ipilimumab  Conclusions Largest proportion of US melanoma treaters will use ipilimumab for 41-60% of their unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma patients Largest proportion of Ex-US melanoma treaters will use ipilimumab for 21-40% of their unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma patients Less than 5% of Ex-US melanoma treaters will not use ipilimumab vs. ~10% of US melanoma treaters  3) Melanoma Treaters Rate Clinical Importance of Clinical Trial of GSK212 (MEK inhibitor) and GSK436 (BRAF) as Highly Important  Conclusions Overall, melanoma treaters view clinical trial testing GSK212 and GSK436 in combination as very high The majority of clinicians rate the clinical importance as high or very high Less than 5% rated clinical importance as low  4) Majority of Melanoma Patients Will Be Screened for V600E BRAF Mutation in the Next Year  Conclusions The majority of US and Ex-US melanoma patients will be screened for the V600E BRAF mutation in the upcoming year ~80% of US patients and 65% of Ex-US patients Less than 50% of patients were screened in the previous year 98% increase in the US and 120% increase in Ex-US  Overall Conclusions Melanoma treaters plan to use vemurafenib in over 50% of their V600E BRAF+ melanoma patients Clinicians plan to use ipilimumab in ~50% of their advanced and metastatic melanoma patients Very little difference in usage between unresectable stage III and stage IV melanoma patients Respondents view the clinical trial testing GSK212 and GSK436 in combination as having very high in clinical importance Melanoma treaters will double the number of patients screened for V600E BRAF mutation in the next year  Final Thoughts: Quick polls are a fast way of measuring expected acceptance of clinical data post major medical meetings, and perhaps can be used to make some assumptions about adoption amongst providers. In todayâ€™s information hungry environment, the speed at which these polls can be conducted and analyzed can be advantageous for market planning and â€œpressure testingâ€ acceptance of data amongst key stakeholders.

"The team led by Dr Murphy used genetically engineered mice and human lung cancer cell cultures to investigate the role of alternate ERBB signaling in mutated KRAS -driven adenocarcinomas and found that neratinib suppressed tumor growth and, importantly, enhanced activity of MEK inhibitors. 2 â€œWe showed that prophylactic treatment with a multi-ERBB inhibitor, neratinib, could completely prevent KRAS -mutant cancer from arising, while Dr Emilio Casanova's team in Vienna demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of a similar drug, afatinib, against pre-existing lung tumors,â€ Dr Murphy said. â€œIt's important to note that both studies demonstrated a requirement for simultaneous inhibition of multiple EGFR/ERBB receptors â€• drugs that only target a single member of this family were ineffective at slowing tumor growth.â€ A limitation of these studies is their preclinical designs, and further work is needed to determine whether a multi-ERBB inhibition strategy would work for patients. According to Dr Murphy, â€œmulti-ERBB inhibitors are already approved for use against EGFR -mutant and ERBB2-amplified cancers, making the path to clinical trials in KRAS -mutant disease much more direct. However, these drugs have severe on-target side-effects on skin and gut epithelium, and these toxicities are presently limiting.â€  Related Articles Biomarker-Based Blood Test May Extend Reach of CT Screening for Certain Lung Cancers Role of BRAF Mutations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Still Emerging, Evolving Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib May Be a New Standard of Care in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Determining a way to focus drug delivery on the target organ would make these drugs more useful in clinical settings. He added that for clinical use single-agent afatinib or neratinib would likely be used in combination with a trametinib or another ERK/MEK inhibitor. â€œWe found that multi-ERBB inhibition was ineffective against established disease when used as a single agent and more effective when combined with a second small-molecule inhibitor. Small molecule screening could reveal exciting new combination therapies that further extend the benefit of these drugs.â€ Although additional research most definitely is needed, the results of these two studies offer hope for patients with advanced KRAS -driven lung adenocarcinoma beyond development of therapies that directly target mutant KRAS. â€œThere are presently no approved drugs for targeting mutant KRAS in lung or any other cancer; indeed, KRAS mutation is widely used to exclude patients from treatment with first-generation EGFR-targeted therapeutics,â€ Dr Murphy concluded. â€œThese two papers now demonstrate that second-generation EGFR inhibitors â€• which also block signaling through other ERBB family receptors â€• show unexpected efficacy in this setting and need to be re-evaluated in new clinical trials for this specific disease cohort.â€ References",erlotinib,2,,,

"Re: ""Will we be forced to receive rituximab off-label?"" I suspect not; we have already tried to get NHS England to give us permission to use rituximab post-natalizumab in our patients who are JCV-seropositive. We are waiting to hear back from them, but the indications are that we won't be able to do so. It is also incorrect to assume that rituximab is a biosimilar of ocrelizumab or vice versa. They are different products. Rituximab is less humanised and hence there is a higher incidence of anti-drug antibodies and more infusion reactions. The drugs also are slightly different in their effector mechanisms, or the way they work. Based on these differences it is very unlikely that NHS England will treat them as interchangeable drugs.",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was signed into law in March 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act. The BPCI Act created an abbreviated approval process for biosimilars, the goal of which is to demonstrate â€œbiosimilarityâ€ between the proposed product and the original product, not to independently establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A â€œtotality of the evidenceâ€ approach is taken by the FDA in evaluating biosimilars for approval. The results from clinical trials are important, but data from â€œpreclinicalâ€ work is also considered. Once a biosimilar is approved for use by the FDA, it can be approved for additional indications (conditions) based on a concept called â€œextrapolation of data.â€ If the data collected on the biosimilar in preclinical work shows the same clinical result as the original product (the biologic), additional clinical trials do not have to be conducted. For instance, the clinical trial for the biosimilar filgrastim-sndz studied its effectiveness and safety in a clinical trial whose participants were being treated for breast cancer. When approval was granted by the FDA for filgrastim-sndz, it was as a bone marrow stimulant for the same five indications approved for the original product, filgrastim:  Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy (treatment that stops or slows the growth of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow). Patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy. Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy (a method of replacing blood-forming stem cells destroyed by cancer treatment). Patients with severe chronic neutropenia (abnormally low count of a type of white blood cell). Biosimilars Approved by the FDA Including filgrastim-sndz, there are currently twelve biosimilars approved by the FDA for the treatment of specific conditions.  2016 and 2017 In 2016 and 2017, the FDA approved six immunosuppresant drugs for the treatment of certain forms of arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s disease. These drugs, listed in the order of their approval, are:  Infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra); the original product is infliximab (Remicade). Etanercept-szzs (Erelzi); the original product is etanercept (Enbrel). Adalimumab-atto (Amjevita); the original product is adalimumab (Humira). Infliximab-abda (Renflexis); the original product is infliximab (Remicade). Adalimumab-adbm (Cyltezo); the original product is adalimumab (Humira). Infliximab-qbtx (Ixifi); the original product is infliximab (Remicade). In September 2017, the FDA approved bevacizumab-awwb (Mvasi) for the treatment of five types of cancer:  Non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) Glioblastoma Metastatic renal cell carcinoma Persistent, recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix Bevacizumab-awwb is approved for the same indications as the original drug, bevacizumab (Avastin) and could reach the U.S. market as soon as 2020, after the patent on bevacizumab expires. In December 2017, the FDA approved trastuzumab-dkst (Ogivri) for the treatment of people with HER2-positive breast cancer or HER2-positive gastric cancer. HER2 is a growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells. The original drug is trastuzumab (Herceptin); its patent expires in 2019.",ixifi,2,,,

"Shurell sounds like an ideal candidate for Lemtrada (having fast acting MS, but only diagnosed two years ago). People with SPMS do not do so well on it. Here's a quote from a paper on the subject (Lemtrada is called Campath in this quote): "" Patients with SPMS (on Campath) showed sustained accumulation of disability due to uncontrolled progression marked by unrelenting cerebral atrophy, attributable to ongoing axonal loss. The rate of cerebral atrophy was greatest in patients with established cerebral atrophy and highest inflammatory lesion burden before treatment. In contrast, patients with RR disease showed an impressive reduction in disability at 6 months after Campath-1H (by a mean of 1.2 EDSS points) perhaps owing to a suppression of on-going inflammation in these patients with unusually active disease.""

"momof8yroldboy I have been constantly thinking about your son and hoping that Remicade will bring him all needed relief.

We tried 8 weeks interval and saw some symptoms re-appear like mucus and traces of blood in stool. Now he is on 7 week interval for the Remicade. He was taking Methotraxate with Remicade which was stopped as he constantly has cold which he is not able to shake off. For last infusion, he did complaint about tightness in chest within 10 minutes of infusion, but disappeared afterwards. I donâ€™t know much about this disease, but thought of sharing this first hand information. I hope things will improve for your son soon.

"Hello @melissa-g & @condasmum: Besides having MS, I happen to work at the company sponsoring Mavenclad. Iâ€™m not in the UK, but the product is the same, only with packaging in different languages. Adveva is the name of the patient support program currently being held in the UK and other markets. I am not promoting Mavenclad in any way, but Iâ€™ve had so much training that I think I can contribute (in part) to your knowledge on the product. I am going on Ocrevus because Iâ€™m not RRMS, but PPMS :(. Mavenclad has, in my opinion, three main advantages over other medications: â€“ Its a short course oral treatment for RRMS (only a few tablets/year for only two years, with sustained NEDA rates in almost 50% of patients after 2 years). No EDSS progression on 90% of patientsâ€¦ comparable to any mAb (Lemtrada, Ocrevus, Tysabri). â€“ Unlike Tysabri (natalizumab), or Gilenya (fingolimod), Mavenclad does not induce continued immunosuppression. It will deplete your B cells, but they will slowly recover over time. This supposedly prevents long-term damage to your immune system. â€“ No cases of PML were reported in any of the 12-years clinical trials that led to Mavencladâ€™s approval by the EMA. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were lymphopenia (which one would expect because its the mechanism of action of the drug) and herpes zoster infection. One disadvantage that I would point out is that switching from Mavenclad to other therapy can be quite tricky. Youâ€™d have to wait for some time before switching therapies, but I guess your neurologist can handle wisely. Also, be sure to check out your family planning before starting: you are advised not to procreate while on Mavenclad (or only in very specific periods of time in between courses of the medication). Doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re a boy or a girl ðŸ˜› Hope I was helpful. Best of luck!",ocrevus,2,,,
"Navigating the world of  multiple sclerosis (MS) can be a daunting task at times. Whether you have been diagnosed for several years or you are newly diagnosed, the ever-changing nature of MS makes living with it a challenge. From the randomness of relapses or flares to the unpredictable progression, it is enough to drive a person mad. Fortunately for some, some MS treatments make this seemingly insurmountable beast somewhat tameable.  Traditional Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Options Many multiple sclerosis treatment options exist for MS. There are pills, injections, infusions, and several alternative treatments available. Finding the one that will give you the best results is key. When I was diagnosed in 2016, my neurologist initially tried Tecfidera, a twice a day pill that helps to keep the troublesome symptoms of MS at bay. Unfortunately, I did not have success with this treatment, so my physician referred me to a doctor that specializes in multiple sclerosis. My MS physician then put me on Ocrevus, an infusion that I receive every six months. While I have had no new lesions with this infusion therapy, I have had no relief of symptoms and have acquired new ones. There are many different  types of multiple sclerosis : Relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Primary progressive (PPMS). Secondary progressive (SPMS). Progressive relapsing (PRMS). Since I have been diagnosed with RRMS, I will focus on the treatments that help this form of MS. The following are some traditional multiple sclerosis treatment options for RRMS: Oral therapy is a common choice for those that are not comfortable with needles. They require a regular dosing schedule and are taken either once or twice daily. These include: Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), Aubagio (teriflunomide), and Gilenya (fingolimod). Self-injectables offer the most options to choose from. You will be trained by a health professional on how to administer this medication. They include: Betaseron (interferon beta-1b), Avonex (interferon beta-1a), Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), Zinbryta (daclizumab), Plegridy (pegylated interferon beta-1a), Rebif (interferon beta-1a), Extavia (interferon beta-1b), and Glatopa (glatiramer acetate). Intravenous infusions are injected directly into the vein and are not required as often as self-injectables. These include: Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), Tysabri (natalizumab), and Novantrone (mitoxantrone). All of these options, as with any medication, come with side effects that may include: Headaches. Flu-like symptoms. Redness, pain and/or swelling at the injection site. Low white blood cell count. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Itching. Joint pain. Infection. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Consult the medicationâ€™s website or your physician for a more complete list. Many of the medications also require regular blood monitoring.  Natural Therapies for MS If you want to steer clear of chemical treatments, did you know there are also  natural ways to help treat your symptoms of MS ? They are far less expensive than traditional treatments and for some, may be more effective. Though they have medicinal properties, many are not FDA approved or have not yet been researched as a proven method of managing MS symptoms.

Ginkgo Biloba has been shown to help with fatigue and the other troublesome symptoms of MS just by taking this supplement daily. Dandelion root and leaf have antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents and can also help relieve fatigue, a common symptom of MS. Ginger also has strong anti-inflammatory properties, among many other things to help with MS symptoms. Turmeric is a natural herb that is commonly used as seasoning. It contains curcuminoids that have been shown to have neuroprotective properties which are important for neurologic diseases like MS. Chinese hemp seed is becoming a more popular choice for help in managing MS symptoms. It has a calming effect on the central nervous system and can help with spasticity. Part of the cannabis family, it contains fatty acids that make it a great option for a natural treatment of multiple sclerosis.

"The Angiogenesis Foundation convened leading retina specialists, patients, caregivers and vision advocates to discuss the need to improve long-term outcomes for people living with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The event was co-chaired by Dr. Rishi P. Singh of Cleveland Clinic and Diana Saville, Chief Innovation Officer of the Angiogenesis Foundation. The participants gave recommendations for improving treatment pathways for AMD and discussed solutions for better long-term patient outcomes. Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in people over age 50. There are two forms of AMD â€“ wet and dry. The progression of AMD varies, but ultimately it leads to partial or complete blindness. AMD is widespread, impacting as many as 11 million people in the U.S. As the world population ages, AMD will be even more prevalent. The number of people with AMD worldwide is  projected to reach 196 million by 2020. The disease can greatly impact quality of life, making it difficult or impossible to read, drive, watch television, recognize loved ones, and to live independently. Up until 2006, there was no treatment available for people diagnosed with AMD. Today, wet AMD is highly treatable with groundbreaking medicines called anti-VEGF therapies; these include ranibizumab and aflibercept. These anti-VEGF treatments work by blocking molecules that cause abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye and drive the progression of wet AMD. Anti-VEGF treatments have dramatically changed wet AMD patient outcomes by helping to prevent and even reverse vision loss in some cases. While anti-VEGF therapies have been revolutionary in the treatment of wet AMD, long-term study data is showing a disparity in patient outcomes over the long term. Without regular injections and close monitoring over the long term, patients in large follow-up studies are losing the vision gains they made in clinical trial settings. â€œOur mission has always been to improve the lives of people with diseases impacted by angiogenesis,â€ said Diana Saville. â€œThe neovascular or wet form of age-related macular degeneration is a perfect example where a huge difference has been made, yet there is much more work to do.â€ â€œOutcomes are significantly better [now] than in the days before we had these medicines. Itâ€™s getting to the point where some of our patients and some of the doctors are forgetting what it was like in the days before we had these medicines. It was pretty awful,â€ said retina specialist Dr. Carl Baker. â€œWe do see patients generally have an improvement in their vision for a while, but our studies are showing that over time many of these improvements are going away. And thereâ€™s a lot of interest and a lot of research into figuring out why that is.â€ During the summit, the doctors, patients and advocates engaged in a substantive and frank discussion about the current AMD treatment landscape and areas for future improvement. Discussion topics included the differences in short-term and long-term patient outcomes, causes for these differences in outcomes, identifying barriers to the desired future state and recommended actions. â€œIâ€™m very happy with the treatment because I still have vision and I can still do the things that I have always done. The first couple of years getting the shots was a very very stressful [thing],â€ said participant Dan Berkery who is living with AMD and receiving anti-VEGF treatment. â€œIâ€™m hopeful that these shots continue to do the job and my greatest hope is that the researchers find a cure because there really are an awful lot of people out there that have macular degeneration.â€ The full summit and a follow-up roundtable discussion will be synthesized in a white paper and published in the fall of 2017. The Foundation will convene a patient-centered AMD summit in October 2017 where more patients can share their perspectives and experiences living with age-related macular degeneration.",ranibizumab,2,,,

"I'd say the answer is it depends, and there's no guarantees. First, when we have a lot of inflammation within our intestine, there's bodywide collateral as a consequence thereof. That over aggressive immune system may target other things beyond our large intestine as extra-intestinal-manifestations of our UC (causing arthritis, eye inflammation, sinus inflammation, rashes, etc., etc.). We have WBCs (the immune system's attack dog) and others circulating the whole body within our blood. Often when we're flaring, our arthritis and muscle pains are at their worst (talk about a double-whammy). Often when we're in a remission, our muscle pains and arthritis pains are gone completely. That's suggestive of such collateral damage, that when the immune system is in a quiet/quiescent state, that our other issues are gone. If that's you, then I'd say there's a good chance that surgery would help relieve you of those pains. Second there's joint and muscle pains that are unconnected with the state of our UC flare/remission cycle, and does not share the above mentioned pattern at all. We can have really bad pains while our UC is in a remission, as an example. If that is your case then a surgery may not relieve you at all from those pains. It's something else going on that is unrelated to your UC activity and body inflammation. If you did want to pursue other UC medications, you've only tried the tnf-alpha-blocking class of UC biologics (humira and inflectra/remicade). There's entyvio (madcam1-blocker), there's xeljanz (jak inhibitor), which have completely different mechanisms of action and a chance at helping.

"Thanks again all. Carm, while PDL1 isn't that relevant for Opdivo, I believe the thinking is that it may be for Keytruda. Is that so? As for the stats, Dianem I understand what you're saying is good advice for most cancer including nsclc, but it isn't for sclc. Nsclc has had so many new advances that the stats are no longer reflective of someone diagnosed today. No such luck for sclc...nothing new in a very very long time (though there are some potential signs of progress recently). So, while I know stats are not reflective of each individual case, they do reflect the overall reality for this type of cancer. Hope is something I'd rather avoid given the prognosis - I'd rather focus on concrete decisions and steps we can take. Each time someone writes a lot of encouraging things, it typically turns out thet are basically talking about or are involved with nsclc...sclc is another ball of wax unfortunately. So, while fatalism is dangerous, for me so is getting all excited about general progress in cancer treatment that doesn't apply to our case. Overall, I'm just trying to be thankful for each day and taking a balanced view toward the future...basically to educate myself and make plans but not make much room for either hope or worry/ despair.",keytruda,2,,,
"From my admittedly limited knowledge ie as a patient, I would be very surprised if using Avastin after Lucentis or Eyelea produced any benefits.

And just to clarify - I wasn't saying Tecentriq wouldn't work - just that his oncologist couldn't give me any data - any info I received I read. Maybe it would be helpful if they published data of the individuals it DID help. Their genetic testing/age/sex/stage etc. At this point I haven't seen anything (doesn't mean it isn't out there). And I was also under the impression SCLC isn't tested for genetic profiles/mutations/markers? At least his current doctor and his initial doctors at Penn said they didn't - that was more for NSCLC. My apologies if I am wrong. Talking to the doctors and doing my due diligence researching - it seems the deck is stacked against him. He is male and it had already spread to his brain at diagnosis. So I just don;t feel very positive. Maybe that works for some people (maybe even most) - but for me I don't want to set myself up for a horrible fall - this is the worst news my family could have received.

"The main question I have that keeps me confused is why my GI doctor, after explaining how antibodies to Remicade can cause a Lupus like condition, sent bloodwork out for the Prometheus test and told me it was fine and to stay on Remicade. Are the ANA and anti-dsANA tests totally different tests for other antibodies? How can Remicade antibodies not be evident in one test and other antibodies due to the Remicade infusions be causing DILE? And why isn't my GI doctor and my PCP aware of this? They told me to see a rheumatologist to find the cause of my joint pain! This is what makes me question the possibility of Lupus that isn't from my biologics. I hope the rheumatologist is a lot more knowledgeable and can help me get the right treatment or stop the Remicade and hopefully see some improvement. Humira is not an option because I tried it first and it failed. I had to have surgery after that and now have a colostomy. Thanks for your replies, friends. I appreciate the input.",remicade,2,,,
"Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) suppresses the maturation of specific tumour-suppressor-like miRNAs in response to hypoxic stress through phosphorylation of argonaute 2 ( AGO2 ) at Tyr 393. The association between EGFR and AGO2 is enhanced by hypoxia , leading to elevated AGO2 -Y393 phosphorylation , which in turn reduces the binding of Dicer to AGO2 and inhibits miRNA processing from precursor miRNAs to mature miRNAs.These findings suggest that modulation of miRNA biogenesis is important for stress response in tumour cells and has potential clinical implications.

EGFR-TKIs therapy statistically significantly delays disease progression in EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRmut+) patients but has no demonstrable impact on OS. EGFR mutation is a predictive biomarker of PFS benefit with EGFR-TKIs treatment in all settings. These findings support EGFR mutation assessment before initiation of treatment. EGFR-TKIs should be considered as front-line therapy in EGFRmut+ advanced NSCLC patients.

Tran PT, Rudin CM, Mol Cancer Res, Jan 30, 2013 We recently demonstrated that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of Twist1 in these models led to Kras-induced senescence. In the current study, we show that silencing of TWIST1 in KRAS mutant human NSCLC cell lines as well as in in EGFR mutation driven and c-Met amplified NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and either activation of a latent oncogene-induced senescence program or in some cases, apoptosis.These findings suggest that silencing of TWIST1 in oncogene driver dependent NSCLC represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy.

"EURETINA award lecture This issue of Ophthalmologica includes the text of the EURETINA lecture, which Francine Behar-Cohen MD PhD delivered at the 17th EURETINA Congress in Barcelona, Spain. In her presentation she stresses the need for a better understanding of corticosteroidsâ€™ mechanisms of action in order to optimise their use in the treatment of ocular inflammatory conditions. She cites research indicating that glucocorticoids may induce retinal cell death through pathways undetectable by classical toxicology tests. She adds that a combination of low doses of glucocorticoids together with antagonists to mineralocorticoid receptors holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for treating ocular inflammation.

Early treatment for ME secondary to BRVO provides best results Patients with macular oedema (ME) related to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) who receive intravitreal dexamethasone implants within the first few months of the conditionâ€™s onset achieve greater, more rapid and longer-lasting visual improvements and morphological improvements than those who receive the implant at a later stage in their disease, according to the results of the multi-centre COBALT study. Among 71 BRVO patients who had ME for less than three months, the mean improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 18.6 letters and 15.3 letters at six and 12 months respectively, following an initial injection of the dexamethasone implant. Over the 12-month treatment period, 32% received one injection and 49% of patients received three injections.

Bevacizumab and ranibizumab show similar efficacy in ROP The findings of a retrospective study suggest that bevacizumab and ranibizumab have similar efficacy in the treatment of type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) affecting zone 1. The retrospective study included 68 eyes of 37 patients. All had initial disease regression, although four patients who received bevacizumab and two who received ranibizumab showed reactivation (p = 0.679) and 15 eyes in the bevacizumab group and 12 in the ranibizumab had incomplete vascularisation (p = 0.725). The mean spherical equivalent refraction at one year was more myopic in the bevacizumab group (-1.49 D) than in in the ranibizumab group (0.98D) (p < 0.001).

"Shocking I know. This time there is a portion of my error involved. I told them last month my secondary insurance was Aetna, technically it is not. It is only secondary for certain things otherwise my secondary is Medicaid. What Iâ€™m not in error about is once again the infusion place waited until last minute to verify insurance. Since the information was wrong, they needed more notes from my doctors and couldnâ€™t get approval done in time to order the medicine. No medicine=no infusion. There were good things with the delay. I havenâ€™t been feeling good for the past few days so doing an infusion wasnâ€™t the best idea. Also realizing I had to do the infusion in their suite as per my last insurance, hopefully now they can come to my home and do the infusion which would be so much easier for me. I donâ€™t have a date yet when it will be completed. I called a few times to see what was the status. Iâ€™m still waiting. Every time I have had my Ocrevus infusion I have had some problem.

"Hello, I was just wondering if anyone knows anything about a problem that I've developed with Gilenya? I've been on it since early April and started with a lot of headaches etc but they settled down somewhat. However, I got a phone call yesterday to let me know that the last blood test I had (on Friday 16th) showed that my white blood cell count is down to 2. It seems that they want to have another blood test in two months time to see if it continues to drop. (usually the blood tests are three months apart) My question is... has anyone else had that problem? and if so, does it mean that I'll have to change meds again?

"6 years, 22 days since I started Remicade. It's done wonders for controlling most of my Crohn's symptoms, but not all. I don't think it will ever be able to. I still have an ongoing issue with fistula and abscess, but then there's the underlying problems secondary to Crohn's like chronic fatigue, kidney stones and psoriasis. But I still go faithfully every 6 weeks to get ""the juice"", I guess you can call me an IV drug user, so to speak, because the alternative is not something I want to go back to. The 24 years prior to Remicade were filled with pain, surgeries, weight loss, depression, probing, worry, loss of friends, anxiety, etc. I don't want to go back there. And because I've been there, I know what the newly diagnosed are feeling. All I can say is, with the advancements every day for the treatment of Crohn's and Colitis, you have better chances at getting thru it.

"The Center for Biosimilars Â® recaps the top news for the week of October 29, 2018.   Rituximab Is Effective in Treating Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus, Study Finds Current treatment for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) commonly focuses on photoprotection, topical therapies, corticosteroids, antimalarial drugs, and immunosuppressive drugs. More recently, B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, have shown promise in treating systemic lupus erythematosus, though the feasibility of treating CLE with rituximab has not been well described.   Biosimilar Rheumatology Roundup: October 2018 With the launch of some of the most highly anticipated products thus far in the biosimilar experience, and with the release of key new data on multiple biosimilar products, October 2018 was a memorable month for biosimilar stakeholders.   Study: New Patients Treated With CT-P13 Discontinued Treatment More Often A recent population-based study examined the prescribing and utilization of CT-P13 versus the reference infliximab in infliximab-naÃ¯ve patients and found that discontinuation and switching were more common among patients who began therapy with the biosimilar.   Biosimilar Filgrastim Proves Noninferior to Reference in PBCM A recent study presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the British Blood Transfusion Society, held in Brighton, United Kingdom from October 3-5, 2018, sought to determine the impact of introducing biosimilar filgrastim (sold in the United Kingdom as Zarzio) on the number of patients who were able to achieve target CD34 yield in peripheral blood stem cell mobilization (PBCM).   As Humira Biosimilars Advance, AbbVie's Upadacitinib Outperforms Adalimumab in Treating RA The arrival of biosimilar adalimumab in European markets has been cause for enthusiasm among those seeking greater patient access and lower costs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, AbbVie (maker of the reference adalimumab, Humira) has revealed that its oral Janus kinase inhibitor, upadacitinib, outperformed both placebo and adalimumab in a phase 3 study.   Largest Study to Date in Patients With IBD Finds Switch to CT-P13 Safe and Effective While real-world data, such as those derived from the NOR-SWITCH study, have been reassuring about the feasibility of switching patients with inflammatory diseases from reference infliximab (Remicade) to biosimilar CT-P13 (sold as Inflectra and Remsima), some ambiguous data in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have raised questions among clinicians about switching in the indications of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.

"If youâ€™ve just been  diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), it can be overwhelming. Learning about the various types you may have, the treatments and the prognosis takes time. Below youâ€™ll find a description of the types of MS, along with a short description of the treatments available. MS can be categorized into four types, with the name of each type describing how it treats the body. Each type can also be mild, moderate or severe.  Symptoms of MS Before receiving a diagnosis, you probably noted a laundry list of symptoms that didnâ€™t make a lot of sense. These MS symptoms may have included the following:  Prolonged double vision and loss of vision (partial or complete); loss of vision typically occurs in one eye at a time Tingling or pain throughout the body Numbness in the limbs, typically on one side of the body Problems with bladder or bowel function Dizziness Exhaustion Slurred speech Tremors or unsteady gait These symptoms can all easily be associated with other serious health conditions; this may be why testing for MS is required to make sure an accurate diagnosis is made.  The Different Types of MS There are four main types of MS:  Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS) Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS) When reviewing different types of MS, it is important to remember that MS is an unpredictable disease and it varies significantly from person to person. Also, there are other, more rare types of MS, but these primary types provide a fairly comprehensive view of what disease courses MS may take in our lives.  Advertisement Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) Though Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is considered to be the first of the MS types, it differs from MS in that it involves only a first episode (or single incident) of symptoms. To be diagnosed with CIS, the symptom(s) must be caused by the same process found in MS â€“ inflammation or demyelination in the central nervous system. The symptom(s) also must last for over 24 hours. The chances of CIS leading to other types of MS varies anywhere from 20% to 80%, depending upon whether brain lesions consistent with MS are found via MRI. If two areas of damage to the central nervous system are found, and they have occurred at different times, or there is an occurrence of a second attack, a diagnosis of MS will most likely follow. The National MS Society (NMSS) describes CIS as â€œtwo to three times more common in women than men. Seventy percent of people diagnosed with CIS are between the ages of 20 and 40 years (average 30 years).â€  Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS) Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS) affects approximately 15% of people with MS. It is characterized by disabilities that begin to accumulate slowly right from its onset. There may be minor remissions, but they seldom occur and are often temporary. The National MS Society (NMSS) states that PPMS â€œcan be further characterized at different points in time as either active (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression (evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or without progression.â€ People with Primary-Progressive MS will have more difficulties with walking and need more assistance with everyday activities. PPMS appears equally in men and women, and the median age of onset is 40 years.  Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of multiple sclerosis. About 85% of people with MS are initially diagnosed with it. People with RRMS go through unpredictable cycles of exacerbations and remissions where the disease does not progress. Symptoms depend on the area of the brain or spinal cord that MS has damaged. Symptoms can come and go where others only appear once and never come back. No two people are alike in exacerbation duration, symptom experience, and intensity or the length and level of partiality in remissions. The Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) states â€œon average, with relapsing forms of MS, women are three times more likely than men to develop this disorder.â€ The median age of onset of RRMS is 30 years.  Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS) 40% of Relapsing Remitting MSers transition into Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS) 15 to 20 years after first being diagnosed. This is a more steadily progressive phase of MS characterized by nerve damage or loss in place of the inflammatory process seen in Relapsing-Remitting MS. SPMS does not have symptoms that all over the board as in RRMS. SPMS symptoms slowly progress with or without relapses. If relapses do occur, they are usually temporary and do not entirely remit. As with Primary Progressive MS, National MS Society (NMSS) states that SPMS â€œcan be further characterized at different points in time as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression (evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of change over time, with or without relapses) or without progression.â€  Benign MS There is a fifth type of MS; this kind of MS exhibits symptoms once but never again. Benign MS occurs in about one-fifth of MS cases.  Treatment for MS There is no cure or MS. Regardless of the staging of MS , the goal of treatment is to prevent disability, manage symptoms and speed up the recovery process from attacks. There are also quite a few medication options available that may slow progression of MS.  Treatment for Exacerbations Corticosteroids and plasmapheresis are both used to during an MS flare-up.  Corticosteroids decrease inflammation. This includes oral prednisone and IV methylprednisolone. Plasmapheresis removes the plasma from the blood. The blood is mixed with albumin and transfused back into the body. This is typically done if symptoms are new or not responding to steroids. See Also Treating MS MS Symptoms And Treatment Multiple Sclerosis Care Sleep Problems MS  You might also like... How Does MS Affect the Body? Treatments to Slow MS Progression There are no medical therapies known to slow progression for the PPMS sufferer. RRMS sufferers have a quite a few options:  Beta interferons are an injection that reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an injection that prevents the immune system from attacking the myelin. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral medication that reduces the amount of relapses. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is also an oral medication that reduces the amount of relapses. Treatments to Manage Symptoms A large part of MS treatment is managing symptoms. Physical therapy may help to strengthen and stretch muscles. In addition, the physical therapist may be able to show you how to perform your ADLs easier. Muscle relaxants can be helpful if you suffer from muscle spasms and muscle stiffness. Other oral medications may be used depending on the type of symptoms noted, such as antidepressants for depression.

"Brand Name(s): , Zykadia Â®  WHY is this medicine prescribed? Ceritinib is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body in patients who have already been treated with at least one other chemotherapy medication and have not improved or whose condition has worsened. Ceritinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.  Are there OTHER USES for this medicine? This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.  HOW should this medicine be used? Ceritinib comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken on an empty stomach once a day, either at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after eating a meal or snack. Take ceritinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ceritinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose of ceritinib or tell you to stop taking ceritinib for a period of time during your treatment. This will depend on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you may experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with ceritinib.  What SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS should I follow? Before taking ceritinib, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ceritinib, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ceritinib capsules.

Many other medications may interact with ceritinib, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's Wort. tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes or high blood sugar, heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, QT prolongation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to fainting, loss of consciousness, seizures, or sudden death), or liver or heart disease. tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. You should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment and for at least 2 weeks after your treatment. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. Ceritinib may harm your unborn baby. If you become pregnant during your treatment with ceritinib, call your doctor immediately. tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You should not breast-feed while you are taking ceritinib. if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ceritinib. you should know that you may experience hyperglycemia (increase in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking ceritinib: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, trouble thinking or concentrating, breath smells like fruit, or tiredness.  What SPECIAL DIETARY instructions should I follow? Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking this medication.  What should I do IF I FORGET to take a dose? Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is within 12 hours of your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule.

What should I know about STORAGE and DISPOSAL of this medication? Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from light, excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( [WEB] ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location â€“ one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.

"Hello, I am approaching my 4 year Survivor anniversary in January 2018,( Stage 4 lung cancer with liver, spine lymph mets! ALK +). After chemo then crizotinib, stable. Started Alectinib April 2016 due to acquired Resistance to crizotinib.  The initial dose of 1200 mg/day of Alectinib was super toxic.  So after much dose reduction and labwork, went down to 450 mg/ Alectinib per day for past year.  Stayed stable. Well, brain MRI last week shows new brain met, 7.3 mm. Left cerebellum. Primary lung tumor stable 1.8 x 2.1 cm. A New enlarged 1 cm. prevascular heart area lymph node discovered on June CT scan was stable on September scan, but still â€œnewâ€.  So, the question is: when patient is on 2nd line tki therapy then develops brain mets and lymph node enlargement, is that considered acquired resistance to the 2nd line drug? I viewed the entire Patient Forum on Targeted Therapies videos presented at Cleveland Clinic. My Radiation oncologist wants to stereotactic radiate the brain met.  This will be the 3rd time for brain radiation, twice previously I have had SBRT to other brain mets. [1st time 4 mets, 2nd time 1 met, now this one. Am wondering how many more times Iâ€™m going to have to be having brain radiation as the remedy as I live with these ongoing emerging brain mets.]   I am going to request from my onc. a rebiopsy to see what new resistant mutations may be present to guide new 3rd line drug if thatâ€™s what he decides would be the best next step.  Didnâ€™t remember any of the doctors on the video mentioning to go ahead and stay on the Alectinib if brain mets and lymph nodes develop.  Thank you.  By the way, also a BIG THANK YOU for hosting the Patient conference and posting the entire video, so helpful and informative.  This GRACE forum is so important and valuable.",alectinib,1,,,

Â She had previously gone thru two combo regimens of failed chemo. Â There is a similar immunology FDA approved drug for lung cancer, Keytruda from Merck. Â  Opdivo and Keytruda were originally develped for melanoma and are being tested for a number of other types of cancer after the FDA approval last year for lung cancer.
 Her oncologist, Dr. Howard (Jack) West, MD, came in and said he had cancelled the infusion. Â The PET/CT scan showed she wasfree of cancer and in remission!Â  He had originally estimated she had maybe 8 months. Â These new immunology drugs, also called check point inhibitors, PD-1 and other names seem to have better success than many of the previous chemo type drugs. Â There are many new clincal trails being tested with these and other simialr drugs, many showing lots of promise
 She is ecstatic! Â There is hope even for stage 4 lung cancer thanks to Brystol-Meyers Squibb and in our area the Seattle Swedish Hospital Cancer Institute, Dr. West and their entire staff. Â 
 No need to fly across the country or to other regions. Â Seek out the best cancer center or two in the nearest large metro city near you, many times a large hospital cancer section or univeristy teaching medical hospital. Check there for oncologists who specialize in your specific type of cancer. Â Be sure they have access to the latest clinical trail drugs or those recently FDA approved as they can many times be the on the leading edge of succesful treatment. Â Of course for less than stage 4, surgery and raditaion can be successful.
 Please stay far away from alternative clinics, doctors and products. Good foods and suppliments can be great for general health but none of them cure cancer, regardless of the many phony testimonials you will see at this site. Â Same goes for Mexico and many other foreign bogus clinics pushing coffee enemas and other nonsense cures for big bucks. Â Medical Phyicians (MD's) only from the top US medical universities.
 THERE IS HOPE!

 I'm also on opdivo, but my scan of last week showed a 2mm nodule in the upper right lobe. My oncologist Â and others will be discussing my case at a tumor board meeting this week. I've Â been on opdivo almost 1 yr. Prior to immunotherapy I was on permatrexed and caboplatin(??) for 1 yr. 6 months without treatment my tumor increased fro 1.2 to 1.5cm that's when my doctor decided to do immuno. I will know their decision this week as to how they will move forward.

"A maintenance DMT is one where you have to keep taking it for the treatment to work - a pill every day, or injections a few times a week or an infusion once a month. Most of the MS treatments are in this category. The other kind of treatment is where you have something once, and may need another treatment a year later but you don't have to keep having it. The three treatments that fit into this category are Lemtrada, HSCT and Cladribine. They all seem to be much more effective than the maintenance treatments. The JC virus is the John Cunningham virus, About half the population carry this by the time they are adults and it is generally harmless. For people having immunosuppressant treatments, the JC virus can give them PML, a horrible demylinating disease, which can kill people or leave them severely disabled. It has been seem most frequently in people on Tysabri (although it's still very rare for them), and there have also been a very small number of people who have got it after taking Gilenya and Tecfidera (I think).",gilenya,1,,,
"Crohn's disease, also called ileitis or enteritis, can affect any part of the gut, from the mouth all the way down to the anus. In the majority of cases, however, the lower part of the small intestine - the ileum - is affected. Symptoms can be unpleasant. They include intestinal ulcers, discomfort, and pain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Crohn's disease affects 26-199 people per 100,000 . Although Crohn's disease typically starts between the ages of 15 to 40, it can start at any age.  Symptoms  Pain is commonly felt on the lower right side of the abdomen, but can affect many areas of the gut. Crohn's disease symptoms vary depending on which part of the gut is affected. Symptoms often include:  Pain : The level of pain varies between individuals and depends on where the  inflammation is in the gut. Most commonly, pain will be felt at the lower-right side of the abdomen.  Ulcers in the gut : Ulcers are raw areas in the gut that may bleed. If they do bleed, the patient might notice blood in their stools.  Mouth ulcers : These are a common symptom.  Diarrhea : This can range from mild to severe. Sometimes there may be mucus, blood, or  pus . The patient may get the urge to go but find nothing comes out.  Fatigue : Individuals often feel extremely tired.  Fever is also possible during  fatigue .  Altered appetite : There may be time when the appetite is very low.  Weight loss : This can result from a loss of appetite.  Anemia : A loss of blood can lead to  anemia .  Rectal bleeding and anal fissures : The skin of the anus becomes cracked, leading to pain and bleeding. Other possible symptoms:  arthritis uveitis (eye inflammation) skin rash and inflammation liver or bile duct inflammation delayed growth or sexual development, in children  Ulcerative colitis vs. Crohn's disease While ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulcers in the top layer of the lining of the large intestine, all layers of the intestine may be inflamed and with ulcers in Crohn's disease. Also, inflammation occurs in Crohn's disease anywhere along the gut; in ulcerative colitis, it only appears in the large intestine (colon and rectum). The Crohn's disease patient's bowels can have normal healthy sections in between the diseased parts, whereas, in ulcerative colitis, the damage appears in a continuous pattern.   Diet Children with Crohn's disease might need high-calorie liquid formulas, especially if their growth is being affected. Most patients with Crohn's disease say that the following foods can increase  diarrhea and cramping: bulky grains dairy products spicy foods alcohol Some people do not feel like eating. In severe cases, they may need to feed intravenously for a short period.  Treatment  Bulky grains, like those contained in bread, can worsen Crohn's disease. Treatment may involve medication, surgery, and nutritional supplements. The aim is to control inflammation, correct nutritional problems, and relieve symptoms. There is no cure for Crohn's disease, but some treatments can help by reducing the number of times a patient experiences recurrences. Crohn's disease treatment depends on: where the inflammation is situated the severity of the disease complications the patient's response to previous treatment for recurring symptoms Some people can have long periods, even years, without any symptoms. This is known as remission. However, there will usually be recurrences. As periods of remission vary so much, it can be hard to know how effective treatment has been. It is impossible to predict how long a period of remission is going to be.   Best foods for a Crohn's disease flare-up Eating the right foods can help people to manage the symptoms of Crohn's disease. Find out more.  Read now Medication for Crohn's disease Anti-inflammation drugs - the doctor will most likely start with mesalamine (Sulfasalazine), which helps control inflammation.  Cortisone or steroids - corticosteroids are drugs containing cortisone and steroids.  Antibiotics - fistulas, strictures, or prior surgery may cause bacterial overgrowth. Doctors will generally treat this by prescribing ampicillin, sulfonamide, cephalosporin, tetracycline, or metronidazole.  Anti-diarrheal and fluid replacements - when the inflammation subsides, diarrhea usually becomes less of a problem. However, sometimes the patient may need something for diarrhea and abdominal pain.  Biologics Biologics are a new type of drug that scientists have developed from a living organism. They reduce the body's immune response by targeting proteins that lead to inflammation. Biologics appear to help people with Crohn's disease. Examples of biologics for Crohn's include:  infliximab (Remicade)  adalimumab (Humira) 6-mercaptopurine (Purinethol) methotrexate imuran (Azathioprine) certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) Biologic treatments can have side effects, include vomiting, nausea, and a weaker resistance to infection. Some studies suggest that the use of biologics can reduce the chance that a person will need abdominal surgery within 10 years to 30 percent . Before the introduction of biologics, researchers put this figure at 40â€“55 percent. Biologics also appear to reduce the risk of adverse effects that can arise when a person uses corticosteroids. There are different types of biologic drugs, and individuals react differently to them. A doctor will recommend a suitable option, and they may suggest trying an alternative or a combination of drugs if the first one does not work.  Surgery The majority of Crohn's disease patients may need surgery at some point. When medications no longer control symptoms, the only solution is to operate. Surgery can relieve symptoms that did not respond to medication, or to correct complications, such as abscess, perforation, bleeding, and blockage. Removing part of the intestine can help, but it does not cure Crohn's disease. Inflammation often returns to the area next to where the affected part of the gut was removed. Some Crohn's disease patients may require more than one operation during their lives. In some cases, a colectomy is needed, in which the whole colon is removed. The surgeon will make a small opening in front of the abdominal wall, and the tip of the ileum is brought to the skin's surface to form an opening called a stoma. Feces exit the body through the stoma. A pouch collects the feces. Doctors say that a patient who has a stoma can carry on leading a normal and active life. If the surgeon can remove the diseased section of the intestine and then connect the intestine again, no stoma is needed. The patient and their doctor need to consider surgery very carefully. It is not appropriate for everyone. The patient has to bear in mind that after the operation, the disease will recur. Most people with Crohn's disease can live normal and active lives, hold jobs, raise families, and function successfully.   Causes The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unclear, but it is thought to stem from an abnormal reaction in the immune system. The theory is that the immune system attacks foods, good bacteria, and beneficial substances as if they are unwanted substances. During the attack, white blood cells build up in the lining of the gut, and this buildup triggers inflammation. The inflammation leads to ulcerations and bowel injury. However, it is unclear whether the abnormal immune system causes Crohn's disease or results from it. Factors that may increase the risk of inflammation include: genetic factors the individual's immune system environmental factors Around 3 in 20 people with Crohn's have a close relative with the condition. If an identical twin has Crohn's disease, the other twin has a 70 percent chance of having it, too. A bacterium or virus may play a role. E. coli bacteria has been linked to Crohn's disease, for instance. Smoking is another risk factor.  Diagnosis A doctor will ask the person about any signs and symptoms. A physical examination may reveal a lump in the abdomen, caused when loops of inflamed bowels become stuck together. The following tests may help in the diagnosis: stool and blood tests biopsy sigmoidoscopy, where a short, flexible tube (sigmoidoscope) is used to investigate the lower bowel colonoscopy, where a long, flexible tube (colonoscope) is used to investigate the colon  endoscopy , if symptoms occur in the upper part of the gut. A long, thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) goes down through the esophagus into the stomach.  CT scan or barium enema X-ray to reveal changes inside the bowel   Complications If symptoms are severe and frequent, the likelihood of complications is higher. The following complications may require surgery: internal bleeding stricture, where a part of the gut narrows, causing build up of scar tissue, and partial or complete blockage of the intestine perforation, when a small hole develops in the wall of the gut, from which contents can leak, cause infections or abscesses fistulas, when a channel forms between two parts of the gut There may also be: a persistent iron deficiency. food absorption problems. slightly higher risk of developing  bowel cancer .

"Ocrelizumab reduces progression of upper extremity impairment in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis: Findings from the phase III randomized ORATORIO trial Show all authors Edward J Fox, Clyde Markowitz, Angela Applebee, ...' First Published November 12, 2018 Research Article https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458518808189 Abstract Background: Upper extremity (UE) impairment is common with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Objective: This exploratory analysis examined the effects of ocrelizumab on confirmed progression (CP) and confirmed improvement (CI) in UE impairment in patients from ORATORIO. Methods: Patients with PPMS received ocrelizumab 600 mg or placebo every 24 weeks for â©¾120 weeks. The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) was administered at baseline (BL) and every 12 weeks thereafter. Prespecified exploratory endpoints included change in 9HPT time and proportion of patients with CP of â©¾20% in 9HPT. Analysis populations included intention-to-treat (ITT) patients and subgroups stratified by BL 9HPT time and Expanded Disability Status Scale. Post hoc analyses included the proportion of patients achieving more severe thresholds of CP and the proportion achieving CI in 9HPT. Results: Among ITT patients, ocrelizumab significantly reduced the change in 9HPT time over 120 weeks, the risk of CP of â©¾20% in 9HPT time for both hands and the risk of more severe 9HPT progression versus placebo. Numerical trends also favoured ocrelizumab versus placebo with respect to achieving CI. Consistent directional trends were observed in subgroup analyses. Conclusion: Ocrelizumab reduces the risk of UE disability progression and may increase the possibility of improvement versus placebo in PPMS. __________________ Dave Bexfield ActiveMSers",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"Hi blueberry, These are two reasonable options. I think one of the most important considerations hinges on the question of how symptomatic your mother is. If symptoms are significant, that may push the decision in favor of an established chemo regimen such as Carbo/Alimta, which tends to be well-tolerated and proves effective for a significant percentage of patients. Immunotherapy, on the other hand, can be extremely effective for a smaller percentage of patients, and often the effect of the treatment takes longer to manifest itself.  Another consideration in the question of chemo vs. a trial is whether choosing chemo first will disqualify a patient from the trial later. Although the trial you mention does not list previous treatment as an exclusion factor, it is listed as a first-line therapy trial. One shouldnâ€™t over-emphasize the importance of this factor, though, since there are many trials of immunotherapy agents and even if this particular combination might not be available, something similar should be.

"A randomized, phase 3 trial of niraparib as a maintenance therapy was initiated in Chinese patients with extensive disease-small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) , according to information from a poster presented at the IASLC's 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto, Canada. 1 Niraparib, a PARP-1/2 inhibitor, is effective in patients with BRCA -mutated ovarian cancer, as well as in patients with non- BRCA- mutated ovarian cancer who respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. SCLC cells demonstrate high levels of PARP-1 expression and are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, suggesting that targeting the DNA-repair pathway may be an effective approach. The aim of the study is to evaluate niraparib maintenance therapy in ED-SCLC. The randomized, double-blind, phase 3 ZL-2306-005 trial will enroll approximately 590 patients with ED- SCLC who demonstrate a response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  Related Articles FDA Grants Accelerated Approval to Nivolumab for Small Cell Lung Cancer COPD May Not Affect Survival in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Lurbinectedin Receives FDA Orphan Drug Status for Recurrent Small-Cell Lung Cancer To be eligible for the trial, patients need to have achieved a complete or partial response to a prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (with the requirement to complete 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin). Patients will be randomly assigned 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo as in the maintenance setting. Niraparib will be dosed at 300 mg once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of at least 77 kg or a baseline platelet count of at least 150,000/Î¼L; patients with a lower baseline body weight or platelet count will be administered 200 mg once daily. Patients will continue maintenance therapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Stratification parameters include gender, lactase dehydrogenase levels, and prophylactic cranial irradiation. The coprimary end points of the trial are progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent, central radiologic review and overall survival. The secondary end points include investigator-assessed PFS, safety, tolerability, and quality of life.

Could the new symptoms not be the result of stopping gilenya? Itâ€™s known for having rebound effects.,gilenya,1,,,
"Hi Galen, such a tough call to make. One of the reasons the rebound effect would concern me is many people will convert to JCV+ over the years. I think the conversion rate is around 2% per year. There is reason to think the Ocrevus is in the same effectiveness class as Tysabri but the details remain to be seen over time, however there are lots of reasons to believe the PML risk is much much lower. Have you considered that drug or Rituximaub? Are they both available in your area? Happy to send you some links with more details, but my wife is on Tecfidera and I am always wondering what the next move will be and when that will be. Either becoming more aggessive with a DMT or moving off Tecfidera which she is on now. In the same situation I would go with Ocrevus personally but that is just based on tons of studies and papers I have been reading and not based on any real medical training (my wife is also JCV- like you).

"Hard to believe it was one year ago that my wife and I received the diagnosis on her cancer.  Going in two weeks from potential pneumonia to Stage IV lung cancer was indescribable.  But, we have been blessed that she has a wonderful oncology team, and that we have had such supportive family and friends.  And, during those dark times of the first few weeks, filled with fear of what might happen to my wonderful wife, I was also blessed to have found this site, that had such straightforward and honest information, and such caring people to let you know you are not alone on this journey.  This site has been such a comfort to me as my wife continues through her trails of treatments. So, here we are a year later, with one successful chemo treatment (and two unsuccessful ones) behind us, and in the midst of a clinical trial (for which we donâ€™t yet know the outcome).  Her cancer is a bit more than it was when she was diagnosed, and we seemed to have traded the initial bone metasteses for liver ones (and adrenal?).  But she is still in great health otherwise, with a wonderfully strong attitude, and we move onward toward the college graduation of son (May) and wedding of daughter (July).  We have been very lucky in that most of the time has been working on  management of side effects of the treatments and not from effects of the cancer itself, and we know the driver mutation and have potential targeted therapy still to go to try if the trial drug does not work. I just wanted to thank everyone on this site again for just being there.  Having a place to read up on the latest methods, see the stories of others going through the same issues, ask questions, and know there are others traveling along with you on the road, has certainly helped me as I go through the emotional highs and lows of having a loved one dealing with cancer.

"My 69 year-old wife (NSCLC adenocarcinoma, surgical resection of lower and middle lobs right lung six years ago followed by adjuvant Cisplatin and ???). Cancer returned one year later in both lungs). Sheâ€™s been on Alimta with Avastin every four weeks for three years with no progression. During this time her blood pressure was always high, even with medication.  Six months ago she decided to take a hiatus due to â€˜chemo brainâ€™. While on hiatus she had a TIA with no complications. She saw a hypertension specialist who changed medication which brought blood pressure down to normal and has kept it there.    Four months into the hiatus she started to have signs of progression and was put back on Alimta alone every three weeks with dose reduced by 20% but no Avastin due to TIA.   After two infusions her symptoms (cough, wet rail sound on exhale,difficulty catching her breath and fatigue) grew worse and she is currently in hospital being treated for possible pneumonia (no fever) or other infection (waiting for cultures). CT shows Ã¢â‚¬ËœgrowthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of something and Pulmonologist wants bronchoscopy to rule out cause other than cancer. If growth is cancer,  Oncologist opinion is that Alimta is no longer working and wants to switch her to Taxotere, bu veryt reluctant to return to Avastin. My question is since her blood pressure is now under control can she not go back to the Avastin?  Since the doublet of Alimta and Avastin kept her progression free for three years we are reluctant to move onto something else.  Is it possible Avastin had a synergetic effect with Alimta â€“ or â€“ was the Avastin alone keeping her progression free?  In any case Oncologist wants to go to Taxotere in order to â€˜knock it downâ€™ effectively but my wife is very reluctant due to hair loss and other more onerous side effects.

"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination use of Keytruda (pembrolizumab) plus carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitacel to treat patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) â€“ a disease that accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all lung cancers â€“ according to Merck, the manufacturer of the immunotherapy agent. The agency based its approval on results from the phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 trial, which was recently presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer. The trial randomized 559 patients to receive either 200 mg of Keytruda (278 patients) or placebo (281 patients) on the first day of 35 cycles. For the first four cycles, all the patients also received carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]â€“paclitaxel. Patients were followed for a median of 7.8 months. The Keytruda regimen prolonged median overall survival by 4.6 months (15.9 months vs. 11.3 months) and median progression-free survival by 1.6 months (6.4 months vs. 4.8 months). Keytrudaâ€™s survival benefit was consistent, regardless of PD-L1 expression among patients treated with the agent. In addition, the Keytruda regimen demonstrated superior response rates (57.9 percent vs. 38.4 percent) compared with placebo, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 44 percent. Grade 3 or higher side effects occurred in 69.8 percent of patients treated with Keytruda, including neutropenia (22.7 percent), anemia (15.5 percent), thrombocytopenia (6.8 percent) and diahrrea (4 percent). This is Keytrudaâ€™s fifth approval in the lung cancer space. The drug is also approved to treat certain types of melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) solid tumors, gastric cancer and cervical cancer. â€œTodayâ€™s approval expands our current lung cancer indications to include combination treatment in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer that is particularly difficult to treat,â€ said Roger M. Perlmutter, M.D., Ph.D., president, Merck Research Laboratories. â€œApproval by the FDA has the potential to mean that KEYTRUDA can be used to improve survival for more patients with this debilitating disease.â€",keytruda,2,,,

"I realize that this is a rather late response to the conversation which originated on 5/2/17, but Iâ€™d to like share my fatherâ€™s experience in hopes that this may be useful to others who are contemplating WBRT. At the age of 77 in 2015, he was diagnosed with stage 4 EGFR+ exon 19 deletion NSCLC adenocarcinoma with liver, bone, and brain metastases.  He had > 20 brain lesions ranging from few mm up to 10 mm in size, but he was asymptomatic from them.  His first oncologist recommended WBRT, which my father was reluctant to do because of concerns about late cognitive effects after radiation, especially in older patients.  We requested a second opinion from a lung cancer specialist at a major teaching hospital.  Decision was made to defer WBRT in favor of Tarceva.   A short-interval brain MRI of 4 weeks was done, and there was a dramatic response after just 4 weeks of Tarceva. All lesions had decreased in size and enhancement, and some were no longer visible on MRI.  My father subsequently had consultations with both a neuro-oncologist (who is the author of the aforementioned paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28391420) as well as a neurosurgeon, and all seem to be in agreement that WBRT would be the last resort, at least in my fatherâ€™s case.  There are probably many factors that affect the decision to proceed with WBRT, but I wanted to share my fatherâ€™s story since he had a positive response to TKIs without the need for brain radiation. To Judy, bmj85â€™s son, and jc587â€™s mother, I wish all of you the best, and hope that there is a very good response to treatment for a long time.  Hope",tarceva,0,,,
"Marcie, I had a slightly different pairing of conventional chemotherapy: Taxol and Carboplatin. It appears your doctor believes pemetrexed (Altima) is a better drug combination for maintenance therapy. I had nearly two years on maintenance therapy, my last infusion cycle added the targeted therapy drug Tarceva to Taxol and Carboplatin. This was before doctors understood that Tarceva would be ineffective against my squamous cell non small cell lung cancer, but Taxol and Carboplatin kept knocking back my tumors. Steff has revealed the secret to conventional chemotherapy side-effects. Once they present, they occur in the same time period after each infusion. If they present, it is a good idea to record the timing of the side-effect onset by hours after infusion. I also had success taking side-effect mitigating medication about an hour before the scheduled side-effect onset. My chemo nurse gave me that advice and it worked for me. In my case, I experienced one sleepless night the evening after infusion (likely from steroids) along with very intense hunger. My nausea symptoms started about 24 hours after infusion and didn't happen at all if I took my anti-nausea medication about an hour before projected start. My most troubling side-effect was joint pain and it started about 48 hours after infusion and lasted several days. Many tolerate Altima and Carboplatin very well. So hopefully, side-effects will be minimal. Stay the course. Tom",tarceva,2,,,
"Hi bh, I donâ€™t see any problem with continuing antibiotics while on Alimta. When my wife was receiving a combination of Alimta and Tarceva, she used Bactrim to treat the skin toxicities. On the other hand, given the lung mass and clot, you may want to discuss with her oncologist whether she actually needs those antibiotics. It is possible that her imaging and clinical factors point to a simultaneous case of pneumonia.  Itâ€™s not unreasonable to return to Alimta after the lasting success your mom has previously experienced with it, although many oncologist would prefer to switch to something new. There just isnâ€™t a right or wrong answer. The problem with Keytruda is that immunotherapies tend to take longer than chemotherapy to show anti-tumor effect, and are only effective for a subset of patients, those you will want to discuss those issues with her doctor as well.

"ALT-803 is composed of an IL-15 receptor fusion protein and a mutant form of IL-15. 1,2 It targets the shared IL-2 and IL-15 pathway, activating immune cells and nivolumab prevents tumor cells from evading them. â€œThe combination of these two different effects might work synergistically to eliminate cancer cells,â€ noted Dr Rolfo and Dr Smits. 1 Significant and invariable toxicity hampered the use of IL-2 cytokine immunotherapy at therapeutic doses. 1,2 But authors of the new study reported that subcutaneously-injected 20 Î¼g ALT-803 per kg once weekly (on weeks 1-5 of four 6-week cycles for 6 months) is safe and did not drive up nivolumab-associated adverse event rates. 2 The authors reported no dose-limiting toxicities for ALT-803 plus nivolumab and did not identify a maximum tolerated dose. 2 In a post-hoc analysis, 29% of study participants experienced a partial response, suggesting that â€œwe can reassert controlâ€ in relapsed and ICI-refractory lung cancer, noted lead study author John M. Wrangle, MD, of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, and his coauthors. 2 â€œWhat's unique about our trial is that it's two completely different types of drugs that have never been combined in humans before, and the trial demonstrated that these drugs can be safely administered,â€ said senior study author Mark P.

No dual-immunotherapies or non-PD1/PD-L1 ICIs are yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for NSCLC. 2 More effective immunotherapy regimens that can bring clinical benefits to more patients with lung cancer and to â€œresurrect clinical benefitâ€ after resistance emerges, represents a â€œhuge unmet need,â€ they noted. 2 â€œThe ability of ALT-803 to re-induce immunotherapeutic response in PD-1-relapsed and refractory NSCLC should stimulate a surge of renewed interest in cytokine combination treatments for cancer.â€ Injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms were common (affecting 90% and 71% of patients, respectively). 2 Two patients experienced grade-3 toxicity (lymphocytopenia and fatigue) and another patient experienced a grade 3 heart attack. No grade 4 toxicities or patient deaths were reported. The study was funded by Altor BioScience, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center. Phase 2 trial enrollment is â€œongoing,â€ the study authors reported. 2 There is reason for caution. As Dr Rolfo and Dr Smits point out, osimertinib and durvalumab showed similar early promise, only to later demonstrate troubling rates of adverse events. But even they express optimism. The study has â€œlaid the foundation for further clinical investigation of the use of IL-15 agonists combined with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors as immunotherapy-based treatments to improve outcomes of patients with NSCLC and other tumors,â€ they wrote. 2 â€œCombination treatments are the future of immunotherapy.â€ References",osimertinib,2,,,

"In the article, Reducing costs while enhancing quality of care in MS, Kister and Corboy urge neurologists to do their part to improve the affordability of MS medications. The unaffordability of MS medications is driven by the outrageous prices that are in no way tied to the benefits these medications provide. The experiences they share include a few simple strategies to lower costs without diminishing quality of care. The one with the most impact is the use of rituximab- the forerunner to ocrelizumab that will likely be FDA approved and available for a ridiculously high price in 2017. The biggest barriers to implementing rituximab use are: 1) most insurance carriers deny coverage because it is not FDA approved for MS; 2) neurologists are afraid of legal action if they prescribe a non-FDA approved product and 3) the drug companies are incredibly good at marketing their products with glossy ads to promote brand bonding, enticing many prominent neurologists with speaker fees, dinners, first-authorship on New England Journal articles for studies they didnâ€™t design, conduct, analyze and so on. Biogen and Roche are already busy creating false distinctions between ocrelizumab and rituximab as they did for Lucentis and Avastin and frightening neurologists into believing they would be harming their patients or at risk of litigation if they use rituximab. Off-label prescribing is what neurologists do all the time, the only legal risk is if ocrelizumab had been proven to be superior or safer than rituximab, data that do not exist and a study Roche and Biogen would be afraid to conduct. The Swedish and Kaiser Permanente neurologists negotiated with their medical centers to allow the use of rituximab in their highly active patients when natalizumab was not an option. Use of rituximab has increased dramatically in Sweden and Kaiser Permanente as the highly favorable efficacy/safety profile and high patient satisfaction becomes clearer. Pharma tried to pressure the Swedish government to halt this use of rituximab, which was met by outrage from their neurologists. Swedish health care authorities reviewed the extensive use of rituximab in MS and deemed it scientifically sound and legal. I urge all neurologists to stand up for their patients as the Swedish neurologists have done and help your patients get access to rituximab.

"Antibodies aren't a foregone conclusion with biologics. Some never get antibodies to a biologic, even without concurrent immunomodulator therapy. Some get antibodies quickly with the best concurrent immunomodulator therapy. I believe the highest odds of antibody formation is early on in the biologic treatment, if it's already been years and you haven't already got antibodies then you likely won't get them. It's easy to test for antibodies and unless they become a problem then there's no reason to discontinue a med. Remicade/infliximab is the oldest uc-approved biologic and it's 75 percent human protein and 25 percent mouse protein. As such, it's generally a little higher odds of antibody formation than the rest. The rest are 100 percent human, and some like entyvio don't even recommend immunomodulators concurrent with treatment with current clinical guidelines. Even in the worst case scenario of antibodies, drug doses can be increased to counter act, in many cases. And antibody formation to one medication doesn't predispose one to always developing antibodies to every medication (It's isolated to one med).

"In terms of healthcare and medicine, oral medications for MS are still considered to be in their infancy. Coming onto the market just five years ago, oral medications for MS were saviors for many. They provided relief from the injections I talked about last week and they provided hope for research of the future. When I was first diagnosed, oral treatments seemed like they were still just a thought, a figment of medical imagination. But a few years later they hit the market, to the cheers and sighs of relief of many patients. The first on the scene was Gilenya in 2010. Gilenya is believed to work by preventing certain types of white blood cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier. By doing so, it is believed that this reduces inflammation and damage to nerve cells. Gilenya seemed to be an answer to many MSers prayers, no more shots! But soon after many began taking it, the reports of side effects came out. This is not unusual, as with any drug there are often side effects. But with such a high profile drug, the side effects were high profile as well. One of the main side effects reported was heart issues within the first 24 hours of taking the first dose. And sadly in 2011 an individual experienced the worst side effect possible when they passed away within 24 hours of taking their first dose. This led to regulation changes including having an EEG prior to starting the medication and being monitored for 6 hours in the hospital after receiving a first dosage. Gilenya has also been known to cause vision, breathing or liver problems in some individuals which has prompted some groups to urge the FDA to use more restrictions on the medication. Thereâ€™s always two sides to every coin though, and some people report wonderful relief from their symptoms and are able to do things they havenâ€™t done in years. Next to emerge was Aubagio in 2012. Aubagio is believed to work by inhibiting the function of specific immune cells that are believed to be present in MS. Patients were happy to have another oral option besides Gilenya, and it proved research was still marching forward. When taking Aubagio, one of the requirements is to have liver enzymes checked regularly as Aubagio could damage the liver. There are also other side effects as well; flushing, hair loss or hair thinning among others. I was on Aubagio for about a year after Copaxone. I experienced major hair loss (at least I thought it was major) and I had a relapse while taking it as well. Clearly my body was telling me it was time to switch! The last oral medication to make its way into the world was Tecfidera in 2013. Tecfidera was formally known as BG-12, it was formulated specifically for people with MS and has been used in Germany at higher doses to treat acute flare ups of psoriasis for years. It is thought to inhibit immune cells and may have specific antioxidant properties that might protect against damage in the brain and spinal cord. The main side effect reported by many individuals when taking Tecfidera is flushing. In 2014 an individual sadly passed away from PML, which prompted more stringent warning labels and JC Virus testing for patients taking Tecfidera. As I mentioned, the only one of these medications I was on (so far) was Aubagio. I experienced what I would consider extreme hair loss (having to clean up the shower and floor every day) and a major relapse while taking it. As for the other possible side effects, I didnâ€™t notice anything else. I loved the idea of being able to take an oral medication for MS instead of an injection, but my body had different plans for me. If I need to transition off of Tysabri in the future, I will definitely look to one of the other oral options before anything else. Like all medications, these come with plenty of side effects. What is important to remember is to always weigh the risk versus benefit. What are tolerable side effects to you? To put it plainly, if the medication is working for you, what are you willing to put up with in order to get that benefit? If your medication makes you feel hot and makes your skin look like a tomato for an hour (flushing), but youâ€™ve been relapse free for a year, which is more important? Or youâ€™ve tested positive for the JC virus, what level of risk is ok with you? Those are definitely tough questions to answer, but with a little honesty and getting real with yourself, it can be done. Husbandâ€™s 2 Cents The one oral medication she tried, Aubagio, didnâ€™t work. Her hair fell out and she had a relapse while taking it, which included â€˜not subtleâ€™ lesions in her brain. It may be an awesome thing for some people, but unfortunately not for her. I personally never noticed any difference in her hair, but I know she did. It was frustrating to watch her be frustrated.

"I can tell you that nearly four years ago, after nearly 25 years of Type 1, Diabetes, and knowing for over two years that I had had background retinopathy, macular edema (DME) hit me on my right eye. This was out of the blue, with my vision acuity dropping to 60%. Due to the location of the leakage, close to the fovea, laser was ruled out. That left only Anti-VEGF as a viable option. One thing I have to say - they worked, thanks God. My vision was restored over the next four months to 100%. It is still so. The caveat - Anti-VEGF injections (Eylea) are no permanent solution. In case of persistent DME, they will be required again. Since 2014, I had on average 3-5 injections per year, with only 2016 being ""injection free"". Pleasant it is not, but hey, for maintaining good vision I'd be more than happy to go through this every morning.",eylea,2,,,
"I don't know Dr Woolmore. I was under a different neuro when I was first diagnosed, but I only saw him once (I think he moved somewhere else). Disease Modifying Drugs are what you are prescribed if you have a number of 'clinically significant' relapses over a certain time (I think it's two years). Generally you start with injected drugs like Betaferon or Copaxone. If these don't work, or the side effects are a problem, you may move to another treatment. Gilenya is taken as capsules once a day. I don't know much about Tysabri, other than it's given in hospital every few months. Any other treatments will depend on how MS affects you over time. You may need physiotherapy or the help of an eye specialist, both of which are available at the QE. I can only name treatments that I have needed over the years. I'm sure others can think of more, most of which should be available from the QE.",gilenya,2,,,

"As it turns out, having multiple sclerosis doesnâ€™t exempt any of us from the relentlessness of life. When it feels like youâ€™re stuck in a fugue state of one bad thing after another, you begin to wish you could throw a flag and appeal to the Universe to throw you a damn bone already. But there are no such flags and the Universe, while supposedly benevolent and all that rot, can be a real bitch when it comes to making it pour when it rains. It makes you start to think that all of life is a test and you just might be failing. It makes you think life is unfair. It makes you forget to be grateful and there is no greater sin. None. I lost another of my feline family this past week and while I want to downplay it and go all high-brow with the circle of life and play Elton John songs to inspire me and help me find the beauty in a long life well lived, I am quite simply not feeling that way even a little bit. When I lost my cat Roger in May, the entire dynamic of the house changed. All of the sudden my little vocal, social pot-stirrer was gone and the house went quiet. Ivan, my littlest kitty, kind of stepped up into Rogerâ€™s void. He talked more. He snuggled up to me and spent every bedtime performing his nighttime ritual of circling my head and head butting my hands and forehead for pets, squawking the whole time. It was like he didnâ€™t want me to be lonely. He was making sure I was OK. (OKâ€¦he was a cat and he probably had none of these sentient intentions at all but it felt like he did and that is what matters to me right now). I knew there was something wrong with him but I was led to believe it was a minor issue. A chronically clogged anal gland (gross) that I needed to keep an eye on. He was happy, playful, eating and taking care of himself like a perfectly healthy little kitty. Exactly like Roger, he was completely fine until he wasnâ€™t. I saw him having diarrhea on the living room floor. I somehow caught him and put him in a carrier without falling on my face. Adrenalin is an amazing thing. I can barely stand up without falling over in my post-Prednisone haze but I managed to catch this little guy and shove him into a carrier. I called my nephew Alex in a panic. He came immediately and took Ivan to the emergency vet. I was so sure Ivan was going to be OK, I didnâ€™t even try to go along. Iâ€™ve been in bad shape. I knew the stress of the trip wouldnâ€™t be good for my ridiculous dysfunctional body. The steroids from last week were giving me the usual backlash. I could barely walk again. The Lemtrada leg cramps were back with a vengeance. Those steroids basically got me one day in the office and that was it. Iâ€™m pissed at Prednisone. That feels both completely reasonable and completely irrational all at the same time. I was in no shape to go prancing off in the cold night to the emergency vet. It was OK, though. Alex would handle it. He texted me from the vet and told me the docs thought Ivan would be OK. His vitals were really good. He seemed perfectly healthy with the exception of the clogged anal gland. They planned to clean him up and send him home with antibiotics. It was good I caught him and got him in but he was going to be fine. Until they went to clean up his behind and do a rectal exam. They realized he didnâ€™t have a clogged anal gland at all. He had a giant tumor and that was what I was seeing extending outside of his body. They called me to explain that even if I chose to operate on him, he would likely never be able to go to the bathroom without difficulty and keep himself clean. He would likely be in terrible pain. He wouldnâ€™t last long like that. Ivan was 15 years old. I couldnâ€™t believe what I was hearing. I had already walked away from the idea that anything was seriously wrong with him. This wasnâ€™t happening. But it was. After a few more telephone conversations with the vet, we decided what had to be done. I wanted to drive out there to be with Ivan when he went to sleep. I wasnâ€™t strong enough to be there when Roger went to sleep and I was already at the hospital that time. Roger was my first pet death. I wasnâ€™t even remotely prepared for how it would hit me. Knowing now what I didnâ€™t know then, I didnâ€™t think I could bear to let Ivan go without seeing him one more time. Alex solved that problem for me by driving 25 minutes back to my house to get me and drive me back to the emergency vet. I held Ivan while he purred so loud he sounded like a warm, tiny little lawn mower in my arms. I kissed him and talked to him and held him tight while his little heart stopped. I didnâ€™t want to let him go when he was gone. He looked so peaceful. Like he was asleep. Like he was a tiny little black sleeping kitten. I wanted to hold him forever. Going from four cats to three was strange. Going from three cats to two is like some kind of seismic shift. The two who are left, Fred and Owen, are kinda quiet. They keep to themselves a bit more. In the last few days since Ivan is gone, though, they are both glued to my side. I know theyâ€™re just cats! But they know somehow. They know Iâ€™m not OK. It probably sounds crazy but I think they miss Ivan too. Since Thursday night when all of this went down, Iâ€™ve been in the midst of another family crisis, completely unrelated. Again, the Universe works in mysterious ways. I needed to be there for someone else. I needed to focus on something really important that wasnâ€™t about me but was about someone I love more than I love even myself. Physically, this wasnâ€™t ideal. Stress isnâ€™t my bodyâ€™s friend. We all know that by now. Iâ€™ve been basically up all night for three days, catching up on sleep during the day. I havenâ€™t really seen much daylight since Thursday night. It feels strange. Three days in pajamas. Three days of waking up when the sun is going down. Maybe the Universe knows what sheâ€™s doing after all. I needed to focus on something that wasnâ€™t my failing body or my poor sweet kitty. I needed to be useful for my family, so I was. The crisis has since passed and things should be getting back to normal. I may actually sleep tonight while itâ€™s dark and wake up while the sun is up tomorrow. Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m going to feel tomorrow mostly because my post-Prednisone, post-Lemtrada body is being an asshole again but I would kind of love to go outside. Breathe some air out there. Feel some cold. See some snow. I know as soon as I type those words that it might be highly unlikely that Iâ€™m going to be in any shape to do those things tomorrow but maybe I will. And if Iâ€™m not, maybe later in the week. Iâ€™m getting better at this patience thing even as I resist it with every fiber of my being. I miss Ivan. I miss my working body. I miss outside (kind of). I miss not having a new fucking life lesson to learn every time I turn around. I miss spontaneous smiles and taking a working body for granted. I miss loving winter! Iâ€™m not sure how I started going down this rabbit hole of things I miss but here I am. How can a little 8-pound fur ball have such an incredible impact on a grown womanâ€™s human life? I honestly have no idea but I miss him to the very core of my being. I hope heâ€™s cozy wherever he is now.",lemtrada,1,,,

Siponimod (BAF312) is an orally active selective modulator of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5. EXPAND is the largest randomised controlled study in SPMS to date. Objective: EXPAND is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of siponimod in treatment of SPMS. Design/methods: Patients with SPMS, defined by a progressive increase in disability (of â‰¥6 months duration) in the absence of or independent of relapses, aged 18â€’60 years and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 3.0â€’6.5 were enrolled. Eligible patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either 2mg once daily siponimod (following initial dose titration starting at 0.25mg) or matching placebo. The event-driven study design allowed the blinded Core study stop after a pre-specified number of confirmed disability progression (CDP) events occurred. The primary efficacy outcome was time to 3-month CDP measured by EDSS. The key secondary outcomes were time to confirmed worsening of â‰¥20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test and T2 lesion volume change from baseline. Safety assessments included reporting of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) and clinically notable laboratory abnormalities. Patients who completed the Core phase were offered to receive open-label siponimod in the Extension phase. Results: Overall, 1651 patients were randomised in 31 countries. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were previously reported, and they are representative of a patient population with SPMS. Overall, 1363 (83%) patients completed the Core study. Median time on study at core study completion was 21 months with majority of patients (87%) participating for â‰¥1 year. There were 449 CDP events (each patient could maximally contribute one event for the primary endpoint). AEs were reported in 85.3% and SAEs in 16.7% of patients. Conclusions: Top line efficacy and safety results of the EXPAND study will be presented. The results of this large controlled study that recruited an active SPMS population with and without superimposed relapses will determine if siponimod delays disability progression in SPMS, and will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of SPMS in a well-controlled trial setting. _________________ Disclosure: Funding source: This study is supported by Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.

"Sorry, that took off before I'd finished! Similar to yourself, I was dxd May 2015 with RRMS after a biggie cluster of episodes within the space of three days. IV steroids in hospital did the job and I made a great recovery. No lasting affect, it was easy for me to be dismissive of my diagnosis. So, I have MS? No big deal, it hasn't affected me and I'll be fine. Three months later I had another partial paralysis episode and after the usual hospital admittance and Steroids, I left with a crutch as I was unsteady. By December I was using a rollator on occasion, by March I was needing a wheelchair for any distance. When I met my Neuro again in June (this year) she confirmed what I'd suspected. Not RRMS but PPMS. I was 55 on diagnosis last year and believe my Neuro dxd PPMS, to allow me the chance of using DMD's. Even now since my change of diagnosis, she has allowed me to continue with Tecfidera, at my request, because, well, you just don't know...it *might* be some good.

"Paul: So the other question would be about your personal opinion about B cell depletion therapy. Dr Martin Duddy, Neurologist: So B cell depletion therapy, it depends kind of how you approach it. From a scientific point of view itâ€™s a really interesting thing to do and thereâ€™s lots of reasons why it might work in MS, but if youâ€™re kind of a more pragmatic person, just look at the data, itâ€™s really great data, and I think you can kind of take that regardless of how the drugs work. So if you look at what they do, weâ€™re looking at virtual stopping of new MRI activity after about six months, very few relapses. I suppose the one thing weâ€™re waiting to see is how good it is on brain shrinkage, so we know that with campath or alemtuzumab it was sort of year three, four, five before we saw the maximum effect. So if ocrelizumab comes in that good on brain shrinkage on top of what itâ€™s doing on stopping new lesions coming through, thatâ€™s a very powerful combination, added to the fact that it does seem to work in both relapsing forms and potentially progressing forms in the absence of relapse. So itâ€™s, yeah, kind of exciting times that those two things together, I think, show and move on dealing with all people with MS. When you speak to people with progressive disease theyâ€™ve just felt left out for so long, you know, every new story seems to be in relapsing disease, so hereâ€™s two big new stories just for progressive disease. Paul: So I wanted to also ask about, is there any kind of timeline for when we might be seeing ocrelizumab available to patients? Dr Martin Duddy: At the minute itâ€™s with the European regulators and I think theyâ€™re about halfway through that process. My understanding is that thatâ€™s likely to reach a decision in the middle of next year. If that goes it usual thing and then comes to NICE it will be a year after that that weâ€™d have the drug kind of available under the NHS, so probably still the guts of two years off. https://shift.ms/msreporters https://www.facebook.com/shift.ms/ https://www.instagram.com/shiftdotms/ https://twitter.com/shiftms",ocrelizumab,0,,,

"I used to visualize multiple sclerosis as a journey. A rather complicated journey in a foreign country where directions and destinations are ever-changing and I donâ€™t speak the language. Lately I visualize multiple sclerosis as a complex maze. Kind of like the one pictured up there where there are various places as you make your way through where you can see light shining in. But many of the places you find yourself in as you continue to make your way through the maze, the light can be hard to see or seems to be gone entirely. Iâ€™m feeling muddled. Iâ€™m trying like hell to hold shit together and be positive, looking forward, MS-doesnâ€™t-have-me Beth, but lately itâ€™s just gotten to be a bit much. I realized recently that my mobility has taken a real turn for the worse since my last relapse in July of 2017. Mobility has always been an issue for me from the very beginning. I mean, having trouble walking was one of my first symptoms. Weird feelings in my legs. That â€œlegs-not-legsâ€ feeling that confused me as I was enjoying a walk around the reservoir at Highland Park. Having to sit down after one quarter mile lap. Being super confused why I suddenly couldnâ€™t do easy things (like freaking WALK) so easily anymore. Walking has always been an issue. Ampyra helps. To be honest, it hasnâ€™t been helping all that much lately but I live in fear of stopping it because any time Iâ€™ve ever done that by accident, forgetting my second dose for example, my legs become completely useless almost immediately so Iâ€™m terrified to test what life would be like without it. Especially not now when I have big things going on at work in the coming week that require me to be physically present on a schedule in places not my office. Iâ€™d be a liar if I didnâ€™t admit that this is messing with my head big time. After my relapse, when I was so unsteady on my feet as a result of vertigo, I finally gave in and got myself a cane. I had to accept that my unsteadiness was impacting my life. I was having trouble even getting to my office when I valet park right across the street. I was feeling home bound and antsy. I rarely left the house (beyond going to work) and when I did Iâ€™d become instantly frustrated because it was awkward learning to walk with my cane (sorry, Stanley, I know you try). To be honest, when my legs are dragging like dead tree stumps a cane doesnâ€™t do a whole lot to make my legs walk any better. I remember at my very first appointment with The Great Scott, my MS specialist, he said there was no reason to believe that I wouldnâ€™t even need a cane until I was in my 70â€™s. He said we were getting me on an aggressive treatment (thatâ€™s what I wanted) and soon, my progression would slow down and Iâ€™d start feeling a bit better again. Tysabri turned out not to be the miracle we both were waiting for, but I had some days in those lighted corners in the maze where I allowed myself to hope that I would feel better. But then that relapse happened and Iâ€™ve never quite made it back to the before stage, even with what felt like a million rounds of high-dose steroids that made me fat and miserable, I am still not back to my pre-relapse levels of ability. Buying Stanley felt like giving in. It felt like failure. But I did buy him and I do use him to the best of my ability and I almost donâ€™t hate it as much as I thought I would. At least when I have the cane, people can clearly see that they should probably not try to mow me down without looking like a complete asshole. Thatâ€™s kind of nice? I havenâ€™t seen TGS since I started using the cane and Iâ€™m almost embarrassed to tell him about Stanley. Iâ€™m afraid maybe heâ€™ll be disappointed in me? I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s strange. For once the girl with all the words is without the right ones to describe how this feels. The closest I can get is that it feels shameful. On the outside I make jokes and use Stanley as an accessory for emphasizing important points in conversation (banging him on the ground is a definite thing I do occasionallyâ€¦I cannot deny it). But on the inside I resent the shit out of Stanley. I feel like heâ€™s the outside sign that I have failed. Iâ€™m stuck about ten feet into the maze and heâ€™s not helping me get to the next lighted corner. I have trouble walking more than about 20 feet. Fifty feet at most. My legs start to literally drag like inanimate objects and then I stumble over a foot every now and then. I canâ€™t turn my head while walking without losing my bearings but Iâ€™ve come to rely on Stanley for that kind of thing. But heâ€™s only semi-effective. Walking any distance at all is a chore. I am realizing lately that this simple fact has kept me from walking much at all. Iâ€™m stuck in a dark corner of the maze and I canâ€™t see my way out because of one simple fact. Am I disabled? Or am I semi-abled? Or am I able but only uncomfortably able and Iâ€™m not about that life full of awkward discomfort? I feel like Iâ€™m not quite one thing and not quite the other. Would a walker help me? Iâ€™m not sure. That just seems like another awkward thing to carry around, get into and out of my car. Another device that doesnâ€™t make my legs work any better at all but gives me something to lean on? Stanley does a pretty good job at that. I guess I could get a rollator that also allows you to sit when you get exhaustedâ€¦but again. Iâ€™m just me. Iâ€™m carrying my backpack full of my water, my drugs, my computer. Collapsing and re-setting a rollator doesnâ€™t really seem practical. Should I get a wheel chair? A transport chair? A motorized scooter? But I CAN walk. I just canâ€™t walk far. I donâ€™t know how to deal with this reality so I try to build a life around that reality and only go places where limited walking is possible. This also means that my progress through life, my progress through the maze, has slowed dramatically. Iâ€™ve got no desire to be social because Iâ€™m too tired from what little walking I have to do in any given day. I can never be sure how much walking will be involved in getting from point A to point B and back again in the outside world. Iâ€™ve got barely enough energy to get me to my office and back home again. Then when Iâ€™m home again Iâ€™ve got barely enough energy to take care of my home and myself â€“ things like laundry, cat care, going to the bathroom and showering all involve many stairs and steps. I live alone in a two story house. Itâ€™s unavoidable. People have suggested to me that I consider things like moving somewhere where I donâ€™t have all of these steps. Selling my home and making a new one somewhere else without all of these challenges in my day-to-day life. Iâ€™ve even thought about other drastic things like selling my house and moving in with my mom. Things that would mean I didnâ€™t have to work so hard or try so hard every day to do a job thatâ€™s meant for someone fully able and not someone semi-abled such as I am. All of these thoughts make me feel sick in my stomach instantly. This is how I know they are not the right thing for me. I canâ€™t give up yet. I still have to keep stumbling my way through the maze, trying to get to the next area in the maze where a little more light shines. The idea of getting to the middle â€“ the place where all of the light shines and I finally understand this disease in a way that makes it bearable to me â€“ that is what drives me. Iâ€™ve lost so much of what I used to think made me, me. I am unwilling to give up even a little bit more. And yet living in this gray area of not entirely DISabled but only kind of, makes life pretty freaking complicated. Walking is kind of an important part of life. I guess I never thought about it much before. Of course I didnâ€™t. Most people do this simple activity without even thinking! I see The Great Scott on April 17, a week before my third Ocrevus infusion on April 23. Iâ€™m going to talk this all over with him. Iâ€™m going to tell him I think Iâ€™m getting worse and Iâ€™m not happy about it. Iâ€™m going to tell him that Iâ€™m not sure how patient I can be with a treatment that is given every six months and doesnâ€™t seem to be making me any better. Iâ€™ve definitely gotten worse. See, Iâ€™m nowhere near 70 and Iâ€™m walking with a damn cane. So thatâ€™s a physical reality that even TGS canâ€™t deny. Iâ€™m going to tell him all of this and hope I donâ€™t burst into tears in front of the ever-present interns. I know Iâ€™m supposed to look at the bright side and believe me, people, I do. I really really do so much of the time! When your legs canâ€™t carry you much further than from one handicapped space to another, it becomes a little bit harder to keep doing that. When you technically CAN walk but you canâ€™t walk very far, itâ€™s like being half-pregnant. Iâ€™m not able. Iâ€™m not crippled. Iâ€™m somewhere in between that feels like no where. Iâ€™m not writing this to worry anyone. I know these dips and dives are part of this MS life. I know this because some of you out there, who are so much more experienced than I am, have taught me this. Youâ€™ve reassured me of this and I believe you. Over and over and over again you have reassured me that I will get better at this. I have to believe that working this daily maze gets better or I would have a hard time rallying to do silly things like win business at work and make money for other people. Iâ€™m not ready to give up silly things like that yet. Iâ€™m just not. Iâ€™ve met a few new people lately. Some who are at the very beginning of their journey â€“ some who are a bit farther along than I am and have much more to deal with in life than a silly job, things like raising kids and having families. The only thing that makes any of this better is knowing that these women (mostly women) get it. It helps more than anything and Iâ€™m not completely sure why! So maybe Iâ€™ve decided to be completely honest about this shithole maze game Iâ€™m playing because maybe it will help someone else feel less crazy? Iâ€™m writing this because usually when I name a fear, or ramble about something I dread, or let LOOSE on all of you like the whiniest, most annoyingly pessimistic friend you never wanted to have, it takes away a little bit of the power it has over me. When I talk about it, suddenly it seems smaller. Less scary. Almost silly. Iâ€™m writing it down to dispel my own gigantic, huge, way too enormous fears. I write them down. They have less power. Itâ€™s like magic. Thereâ€™s gonna be an epic meeting on April 17 when I hit The Great Scott with all of this. It will make for a great blog post (meetings with TGS usually result in my favorite blog posts since I find him completely delightful). I will clearly and calmly recount how much this sucks and ask him if we can really still believe that this â€œmiracleâ€ drug is actually the right one for me after all. And I will introduce him to Stanley.",ocrevus,2,,,
"Hi bfarz, Congratulations on the great scan report; glad that you can stick with Tagrisso and that it continues to keep your cancer under control. If you have a mixture of indolent BAC and adenocarcinoma, there is always the possibility that the invasive component can become more aggressive, although your long history of slow/no growth makes that less likely.

"The top-down approach is the trending therapy recommendation used by many gasteroenteroligists. Start with the stronger meds much, much earlier within the treatment process to extinguish and control UC before it spreads in extent and severity. That produces the best quality of life, controls it fast, and lets you move on while in a remission and forget about a UC. You could try small adjustments for the next 6-months and not be much, if any, further along in getting past this flare. 5 bms a day puts you at the high-end of a moderate flare, and the low-end of a severe flare. Humira is a perfectly reasonable recommendation with those symptoms. If you're feeling pretty good at 5-bms a day, then you're really forgetting what 1-bm a day is like, and how a remission would be a whole lot better quality of life through stronger treatments. Saying ""well 5 bms a day is at least better than 7"" is a trap, it's not the best you can do, you can do a whole lot better. What good is saving a trump-card up your sleeve, if it is only a joker?

"Angie Randall is a Chicago mom living with multiple sclerosis. I am excited to introduce Angie and her optimistic and informative website  Well and Strong with MS to you.   How many years have you lived with MS? Iâ€™ve had MS for 2.5 years.  What medication(s) do you use? Iâ€™m on Tysabri which is a monthly infusion. Iâ€™ve been on it for one year and have had great results from it (knock on wood!).  Do you do any natural therapies or treatments to fight MS? I try to eat a clean diet (mostly carb/gluten free), exercise regularly and get a lot of sleep. I think rest is key with MS!   How has MS affected you as a mother? There are certainly precautions Iâ€™ve had to take and parts of my life Iâ€™ve had to modify but Iâ€™ve been able to figure out a â€œnew normalâ€ in motherhood. I definitely make my health a priority not only for myself but also for my daughter.  What is something about MS that you wish more people knew? That itâ€™s not the end of the world! When I was first diagnosed, I assumed the worst. I thought my life would never be the same and while thatâ€™s true to some degree, MS is not the same disease it was 10 or even 20 years ago. Medications and treatments have advanced so much and new treatment options are coming out every year. Iâ€™m able to live a very full and active life with the disease which I try to demonstrate to others through my blog, â€œ  Well and Strong with MS â€. I started my blog to show people just that.  Any advice for someone whoâ€™s newly diagnosed? I know itâ€™s overwhelming at the beginning, but Iâ€™d suggest a couple of things:  Find a neurologist you trust; interview a few until you find someone that you are really confident in Seek out others who are thriving with the disease and see what they attribute their success to be and learn from them Take control of your own situation and find a medication or treatment option that works for you Be positive! This is hard to do in the beginning but itâ€™s going to be your best asset throughout your MS journey What do you think is the future of MS treatment?

"This weekend's post about alemtuzumab not working in some people after fingolimod begs the question ""How we should transition people from fingolimod onto something else?"" We have had this debate about natalizumab already. Look for the posts on this aspect. HIGHLIGHT  Fingolimod and Natalizumab are ""racehorse"" drugs They keep cells trapped to stop them entering the brain As they are not killing drugs, disease forming cells can accumulate over time They are ""under starters orders"" to race to the brain. Stop drugs and disease ""rebounds"" in some people There are many *****LIMOD trials ongoing to take on fingolimod and Siponimod. What measures are in place for me when the drug supply stops at the end of the trial. How is rebound going to be prevented, even if it is a progressive (or what every you want to call it) MS trial?  These drugs are not killing drugs... they are trapping drugs and for fingolimod they trap disease-causing cells in lymphoid tissue and for natalizumab they trap-disease causing cells in the blood. They do not stop the disease process and so the disease causing cells can accumulate and are trapped, whilst drug treatment is in place. However, see these cells as racehorses waiting to run into your brain, and they are ""under starters orders"" waiting to go. The gates open and ""they're off"" Remove drugs and the cells escape, get into the brain and disease activity occurs. Whilst some people view progressive MS, as a different disease, this I think is a dumb view and importantly a dangerous view. It is very clear than there are many people with active lesions that come and go as the progressive course carries on. If you look in the pathology of people with progressive MS there are active lesions. It is clear that some people with progressive MS benefit from immune-inhibition. However, I think it is also the case that the ""racehorse drugs"" allow the accumulation of damaging cells in people with progressive MS to such an extent that the drugs convert their subclinical relapsing pathology into relapsing-active MS, with a time-bomb ticking once drugs are stopped. This is because the horses are all lined up and waiting to go. Stop drugs and relapse occurs...this is sometimes called Rebound. Call it ""resumed (synchronized) relapse"" in case you don't like the word rebound...but they are damaging by what ever name you call them and it need to be avoided. Does this happen? Sure it does!

"Janine, Thank you for your response. I appreciate the knowledge and expertise that this forum brings to address this awful illness. Unfortunately, this disease hits people of all ages and everyoneâ€™s experience is different but I find it helpful to hear other peopleâ€™s stories. Maybe the experience I share about my mother can help those in similar situations. Through this forum and others, Iâ€™ve learned a lot about the course of this disease and the diagnosis and treatments often undertaken by patients much younger than my mother. The difference I see between the testing and treatment regimens pursued comes down to the goals involved. Given my motherâ€™s advance age and frailty, my familyâ€™s decision making process is driven primarily by the goal of maintaining or improving her quality of life followed by the goal of extending time. For younger patients who are able to tolerate more, I think the reverse is usually true. With these goals in mind, comes the question of off-label use in the last line setting. Often times, especially in cases of cancers, doctors have been able to prescribe off-label treatment and insurance has picked up the tabâ€“which depends on the argument presented. I feel that there is too much uncertainty with the testing for the T790M which could leave out a large population that can benefit from Tagrisso. Iâ€™m interested in hearing opinions about the circumstances and conditions it would be considered for off-label prescription as a last line treatment for inconclusive T790M test results.  By seeking off-label use of Tagrisso, it is in keeping with the goals we have for the treatment of my motherâ€™s illness. We will continue monitoring her condition through monthly liquid biopsies and chose treatments that pay the greatest dividends and corresponds with our goals. Hopefully, one of these tests will come back positive and this will not be an issue for my family. Chi",tagrisso,2,,,

"Yet another chapter begins in my MS history of trying to keep this disease at bay. Yesterday I was infused with Rituxan, my seventh attempt at therapy. I've tried interferons (Rebif), Copaxone, and Tysabri. I failed to get on a clinical trial for Lemtrada. After five years of relative bliss following my stem cell transplant, the creep returned and I moved on to Aubagio, which only steadied the ship somewhat. So now it is Rituxan, a slightly modified form of which is expected to be approved late this year by the FDA (Ocrevus, aka ocrelizumab). Ocrevus is soon to be the only recognized therapy for progressive multiple sclerosis, so Rituxan is a logical choice for me. Why? In the months prior to my stem cell transplant, I began a precipitous slide with and without relapses, perhaps a precursor to secondary progressive MS. The transplant stopped that dramatically, but only for so long. I have not had a relapse, but the familiar un-ebbing slide restarted. Aubagio helped nip that, but I felt I needed to get more aggressive. And with Ocrevus still months away, I took a shot at getting Rituxan off-label. I was initially denied by my insurance company, but my MS specialist doc talked them around. The first transfusion went pretty well, although I did have a slight allergic reaction a couple hours in (redness on face and itchiness). A little extra Benadryl and prednisone cleared that up and things went smoothly from there, although I was pretty dopey (insert joke here). Took about six hours, as AMF Adventures predicted. Next infusion is in two weeks, and then six months (ish). I'll keep folks abreast here about my progress, although maybe that's a bad word to use. How about ""successes"" and lack of progression!

"I have absolutely no idea why any self respecting neurologist would only offer someone with RRMS a beta-interferon rather than any other options for a first line DMD. The beta-interferons will only have you an estimated 30-35% reduction of relapses. Now if you're on say Rebif and have been successfully for 10 years, then I can see why you'd not want to change. But for a first DMD, why would your neurologist not offer you Tecfidera or Gilenya? Either would give you about a 50% relapse reduction. Some people have been given Lemtrada as a first DMD. Now that's bold. Side effects serious, yet expected outcome with regard to the MS, excellent. I would definitely be going back to your neurologist and asking for more choice, certainly for an oral therapy rather than an injectable.

"Hi Steve, You are correct in that the value of using Tarceva in the adjuvant (post-surgery) setting has not been clearly established, but there is some evidence that long-term treatment with Tarceva may be beneficial. There is a very thorough discussion of the use of Tarceva in this setting in this GRACEcast video. Of course, as is stated in the discussion, there is the possibility that the lung cancer has already been cured with surgery, radiation and chemo. Thereâ€™s just no way to know. Although I tend to be a strong supporter of obtaining second opinions, as you can see from the discussion reasonable oncologists can differ in their assessment of the available data, so Iâ€™m not sure that if you get a different answer you can assume that the initial opinion is wrong.

"Last week we discussed inject-able medications. This week letâ€™s discuss the oral medication options that are available. Oral medications didnâ€™t hit the market until just recently. Before then, people with MS were stuck with injection only options, which was clearly not ideal. As patients, we would hear about oral medications being an option someday in the future, but we didnâ€™t know when it would actually happen. Until it eventually did in 2010 when Gilenya was approved by the FDA. Currently there are only three oral medications on the market approved for relapsing remitting MS. Letâ€™s take a closer look at each of these medications.  Gilenya Gilenya is in a new class of medication called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator (thatâ€™s a mouthful). Scientist think that it works by keeping certain white blood cells in the lymph nodes, thereby making it impossible for them to cross the blood brain barrier and get into the central nervous system. Making it so the cells cannot get into the central nervous system, reduces inflammation and damage to nerve cells. In several studies done, Gilenya was shown to be effective. Gilenya cut relapses by 52% when compared to Avonex in a one year study. It also prevented relapses by 54% when compared to placebo over a two year period. The FDA approved the use of Gilenya in 2010 for relapsing remitting MS. There are several side effects associated with Gilenya. Headache, slowed heart beat, weakness, fatigue, infection, elevated liver enzymeâ€™s and diarrhea were noted. An uncommon side effect is macular edema, which is the swelling of an area of the retina which is responsible for central vision. Gilenya is also known to slow the heart rate significantly, especially in the first month of treatment. An individual also might feel really tired, have heart palpitations or chest pain or feel dizzy. Usually if someone experiences the symptoms, they will disappear within the first day or two of treatment. In 2012 the FDA updated the regulations around a patientâ€™s first dose of Gilenya. It is now required that an individual have an ECG before receiving the first dose and again six hours after the first dose. Is also recommended that the first dose be taken under medical observation. This is due to a patient unfortunately passing away in late 2011 after taking their first dose of Gilenya. As far as I know, the has not been definitively linked to Gilenya.  Tecfidera Tecfidera, also known as dimethyl fumarate, is an oral medication taken twice a day that was specifically developed for people with relapsing remitting MS. A similar chemical compound called Fumaderm, has been used in Germany for many years to treat flares of psoriasis. The specific way Tecfidera works is still unknown, but scientist think that it activates certain pathways in the body that help to protect nerve cells from damage and inflammation. In one study, in a two year period 27% of people who are taking Tecfidera experience a relapse compared to 46% of people in the placebo group. Tecfidera was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the use in relapsing remitting MS. Common side effects of Tecfidera include flushing, stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. Side effects seem to be present more so at the beginning of treatment, and then will dissipate as treatment progresses. There have been cases of PML reported in patients who are taking Tecfidera, 4 of them actually. PML is a rare and deadly brain disease that can happen when individual is taking an immuno-suppressant medication. In order to develop PML, individual must be positive for the JC virus first. Routine blood test to monitor JC virus status is recommended when taking most MS meds.  Aubagio Aubagio, also known as teriflunomide, is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor. It works by reducing the number of white blood cells in the central nervous system, decreasing inflammation overall and protecting nerves in people with MS. In several studies, Aubagio was proven to be effective over placebo, reducing relapses by 31%, reducing disability progression by 30% and showing an 80% decrease in brain lesions. Aubagio was approved in 2012 by the FDA for use in relapsing remitting MS. Common side effects of Aubagio include headache, nausea, hair loss, diarrhea, elevated liver tests, like symptoms and numbness or tingling in in the hands or feet. Less common but more serious side effects include elevated blood pressure, increased risk for infections and liver damage. While taking Aubagio you will need to have regular blood test to monitor liver function and blood cell counts. Aubagio is also associated with severe birth defects, and neither women nor man should be taking Aubagio if pregnancy as planned. Aubagio can remain in your body for up to two years after discontinuing the medication, so a special treatment may be needed to remove the drug from your system if youâ€™re planning on becoming pregnant. Usually when taking the medication, it is required that an individual be on an effective birth control method. I took Aubagio for about a year. Unfortunately I went into the treatment already in a â€œactive disease state â€œ, and had two relapses while taking the medication. I liked how I could just take a pill instead of the daily injections of my previous Copaxone, but I soon experienced side effects of (a lot of) hair loss and irregular blood cell counts. Due to the relapses, I eventually changed medications. The arrival of oral medications has been a welcome relief for many MS patients. They represent the constant advancement of research and development. Hopefully the future will bring many more options to the table.",gilenya,1,,,

"I had a very poor experience with Gilenya. In 2011 I was doing well on Tysabri but my PML risk was high. My doc switched me to Gilenya and I had 2 relapses in the next 11 months. I was put back on Tysabri despite the high PML risk and never fully recovered from those two relapses. Subsequently learned I had sustained permanent heart damage from the Gilenya. When my PML risk went through the roof in early 2014 my doctor refused me any more Tysabri. I was so desperate to stabilize my MS I traveled from the US to Germany for Lemtrada. I was looking for a way to just not get any worse. After a few rough months of heavy fatigue my MS started to stabilize and then IMPROVE! I was stunned. MS never really improves- we get major relapses and might recover some of those losses back but this was totally new. Things were improving that I had been dealing with for a long time- immense fatigue, cognitive problems, pain issues, jumping muscles, eye sight (my pupils had stopped constricting, and now they did again- oh the relief that is on a sunny day). So many more. I would strong urge you to consider Lemtrada in this time of change. I would be happy to talk with you more about Lemtrada or you can read my blog of my first year on Lem (lemtrada.blogspot.com). Fellow member @tracyd has also had Lemtrada and has her own blog. Lemtrada is the strongest medicine we have to fight back against MS. If you can spare a week of your life to get the medicine, then you basically just have to wait for it to work after that (3 more days a year later). But you donâ€™t have to take a pill every day and the medicine is out of your body in 3-4 weeks but keeps working to keep your MS at bay. Best wishes in your search for the right treatment for you!

"Hi I thought Cladribine was for relapsing remitting MS or for people with SP but still having relapses. As far as I understand it, the idea is that it works on lymphocytes, targeting the bad bits of the immune system that attack the myelin in relapses. But some people who've had it will know more about it. Meanwhile, try to do some more research into the drug and that might ease your anxiety. Either you'll decide it's a drug you can cope with, or that it's not. One way or the other, as Carole said, try not to get stressed about it. Stress and MS really don't go well together.

"Hi. Iâ€™m new to shift ms and Iâ€™m in need of advice regarding treatment. When I was diagnosed I was put in tecfadera, this gave me terrible side effects and I was moved to aubagio. Which has failed miserably. I have had 3 relapses in 12 months and 5 in 2 years. So I got a letter saying that I could be moved to Gilenya, tysabri or lemantra. But I have psoriasis and the Neuro was looking for one that would treat both. He asked my dermatologist and thatâ€™s it possible (its not) and I heard him say Iâ€™m probably going to give her Gilenya then. My question is do I have a say? Iâ€™m not keen on his choice as Iâ€™m worried about the side effect of macular oedema. I have virtually lost the sight in 1 eye due to optic neuritis and I can not lose my license as I live on a farm miles from anywhere. Can I ask for a different one? The ms nurse sent me information on the 3 treatments that were in the letter and Iâ€™m leaning towards tysabri. But like I say I donâ€™t know if i have a choice. Any help would be great. I feel very confused & Iâ€™m worried about progession and I need these relapses to stop! Thank you.",gilenya,2,,,
"Hi Jackie, Iâ€™ve not heard of correlations per se.  Taking afatinib after progressing on tarceva hasnâ€™t shown to be effective in stopping cancer progression and vice versa.   If there is a t790m mutation acquired while on tarceva or afatinib then thereâ€™s a good chance that tagrisso will have efficacy but any correlation to the timing is unknown.  The mechanism of resistance to tagrisso is too new to have much of an understanding just yet.   You didnâ€™t ask but I wonâ€™t hesitate to try to guess what else may be of help.

"Click here to receive MS news via e-mail The story showing below was written by an MS Patient, named Laura. To fully understand the title of this blog posting, please read Laura's entire story as it will make sense ================================================================= COST EFFECTIVENESS IN MS TREATMENTS When I question this, the explanation given is fairly predictable and had to do with negotiated payments and how my insurance was not going to pay that much and it would be a significantly reduced amount that was eventually paid. For the increased bill of $24,908 the clinic provider is â€˜onlyâ€™ paid $12,578. $160,000 per year is the real cost for my treatments based on todayâ€™s pricing, which is still a staggering amount to consider. I continue to have my own mental struggle as to whether this amount of money is worth it in the big picture, considering my age and other factors. Is it fair for my treatment costs to affect the health care dollar costs like this and take a sizeable chunk out of the available monies? How much does my treatment affect the escalating costs of health insurance? MS is a chronic disease that as of now has no known cure and I could conceivably continue on this treatment for the remainder of my life, amassing treatment costs in the millions of dollars. Fortunately for me the entire cost of treatment is covered by my private health care insurance along with the patient assistance program for Tysabri costs. I have paid nothing out of pocket all these years but I imagine these types of bills are part of what is driving up the cost of health insurance, for which I do pay a lot and so does everyone else. Just when I think I am over being angry or frustrated by my MS treatment cost there is often another reminder of this escalating bill, usually in the form of a notice from my insurance telling me how much they had been billed and actually paid. Todayâ€™s reminder came in a different way â€“ through the writings of Dr. Gavin Giavanonni, and Bartâ€™s MS Blog , written by MS doctors and researchers with the departments of Neuroimmunology, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, in the United Kingdom. In this particular article they talk about NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK. One of the functions of NICE is to set pricing for healthcare treatment, including drug costs. NICE decides on what they consider a fair price to pay for a drug and then looks at other options for treating the patient and then decides which would be most cost effective for their government health care system. The blog authors are also concerned about affordability and accessibility of drugs and how the policies of NICE affect treatment and posted this observation from a recent conference â€œAnother ground-shifting poster was the ORATORIO study results (ocrelizumab in PPMS). This study is the first study to show a DMT slowing the rate of disability progression in PPMS. This has to be one of the most significant things to happen in the field of MS in the last 10 years. Despite this I am concerned that NICE may not view ocrelizumab as a treatment for PPMS very favourably. NICE always assesses cost-effectiveness using an incremental cost model. For PPMS the cost-effectiveness of ocrelizumab will be compared to what is out there already, i.e. best supportive care.â€ Their writing had me thinking again about my own treatment cost and now I also wonder if I could put a price on what it might cost to provide me with supportive care compared to the money being spent on my drugs. For now I would not need much in the way of help and all of the money could be spent on someone else. But that picture could change very quickly if my MS progresses because I was not on treatment and I found myself dependent on health care services for my activities of daily living. Would that amount of money take care of me if I were in a nursing facility? In 2013 the average daily cost of nursing home care was $248/day or about $90,000. Just think of the money that would be saved if somewhere someone decided the cost effectiveness of my Tysabri showed that health care money would be better spent by putting me in a nursing home? Reading this question in the Bartâ€™s MS Blog makes me concerned for all of us because the cost effectiveness model might be whatâ€™s needed to control our drug costs here in the US. In some ways our insurance companies are already doing a form of this by often denying treatment or authorizing only certain drugs for reimbursement but not all of them. The topic of cost effectiveness is one of the core points listed in the North American Registry for Care and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (NARCRMS) project, a major initiative for the US and parts of Canada looking to link patient clinical data together. â€œHealth Care Economics Core Will identify information to be collected in the database regarding disability, utilization of health care resources, and employment to help better understand whether the use of expensive therapies has been worthwhile from an economic standpoint, what are the savings from fewer hospitalizations, less disability and longer employment spans, and decreased utility of other health care resourcesâ€ Unlike the system in the UK which helps with the other costs of living such as housing, transportation and medical care for people who are in need due to the financial demands of living with a chronic illness, we donâ€™t have that broad ranging assistance here in the US. My health insurance would not pay any of these living costs â€“ but they will pay for my drugs. Being financially responsible leaves me little choice â€“ I will continue on these treatments despite the escalating costs and my lingering questions and do my best to avoid future care needs that I would have to pay from our own resources. In the meantime I just hope the next bill I open doesnâ€™t cause me to require treatment from choking on the price. be well, Laura http://insidemystory.com/ =============================================================== MS Views and News Providing educational information, resources and services for those affected by MS",ocrelizumab,0,,,
"Hi Janine, Sorry for the late reply.  I asked for an echo to make sure it was CHF as they insisted it was and to please do a thoracentesis to make sure it was not cancer.  Mom had a thoracentesis and the biopsy of the fluid showed cancer. She also had an echocardiogram done last Thursday which was â€œnormal for her ageâ€ according to the cardiologist.

"Hey everybody, just wondering if anybody here has thought about or dealt with fertility issues during/after melanoma treatment. My husband went on BRAF inhibitors but was unable to go to a sperm bank beforehand, and according to the side-effects those drugs can make a person infertile. Before he got sick, we had hoped to have kids someday (I just turned 30, he's in mid-30s). Right now we're still in the middle of cancer treatment. He had a very high tumour burden and we're still not sure if Keytruda is working, although things look very cautiously optimistic (symptoms are stable or even slightly improving). And even if Keytruda is working, we know his chances of being a complete responder are pretty low considering the seriousness of his disease. But still ... Have to think about the future and stay positive, right? So I find myself wondering about whether we can ever have kids if his situation stabilizes. Has anybody else dealt with something like this? What should we do? I wonder if I should go, like, get my eggs frozen or something?! (I don't even really know what that means.) Our sex life has been non-existent for about 7 months now (low testosterone, lots of pain killers, and he's unable to go on hormone replacement therapy) but we're pretty sure the traditional way wouldn't work for us anyway.",keytruda,1,,,
"By now, if youâ€™ve read anything of this blog you know that I am a daily writer. Iâ€™ve written in a journal for over 20 years. I have stacks and stacks of paper books full of my scribbles. These days I use an actual app and I journal on anything â€“ my phone, my computer and my iPad. Along with my Precious (aka my therapist Cheryl), I donâ€™t have much hope of remaining quasi-sane without daily journaling. Writing is cathartic for me. Itâ€™s something I do because I need to do it â€“ not because I want to. I canâ€™t not do it. So imagine how happy it makes me when you guys tell me you like reading something Iâ€™ve written. Itâ€™s beyond anything I could have ever wished for. I started putting my personal writings on this blog because I needed a community. I needed to find people like you all that I could learn from. Real people with real MS who were bound to be so much better at managing this disease than I am at present. I have great doctors, I really do, but it shocks me to this day how The Great Scott, while clearly one of the very best among MS specialists out there, still doesnâ€™t quite get it. I know this every time he asks me, â€œWhen did you last walk a mile, Maribeth.â€ I resist throttling him mostly because I like him and I need his big brain. Unless you have MS, you canâ€™t possibly understand what it feels like to have it. You can empathize and listen and love and help. Iâ€™m grateful for all of those around me who do these things consistently every single day. But you also need a community. So I found one. Props to http://www.trippingonair.com/ for being my original inspiration to take my writing public. You should check her out. She wins awards and stuff and is one of my personal favorite MS bloggers out there. All of that said, I still write in my journal things that I need to deal with in writing first and foremost for myself. Things that are private (believe it or not, I do keep some things private. Not much! But a small few topics). After infusion #2 of the new goo (Ocrevus for the newbies) I found myself struggling to write Musions on My Newest Infusion #2, which would have been the next logical blog post. I went to bed, tired to the bone from the juice, but not able to sleep. So I did what I usually do when that happens. I wrote in my journal. This morning, when Iâ€™d read over what I wrote to myself last night it made me realize that I needed to share it here with you all, as well. It was the best description I could give about how I felt about this infusion #2. So Iâ€™m repeating it here (verbatim, no editing so thereâ€™s probably a million writer mistakes included). I should first apologize for this marathon long blog post. Folks that get through the whole thing might just be super human! People generally like short pithy posts, or tips or hacks or whatever. Thatâ€™s not me. Oh well. Gotta be me. So here it is: It was infusion day today. Big number 2. I havenâ€™t blogged about it yet but wanted to talk about it here, with myself, because Iâ€™m already in bed too late for getting maximum rest before attempting to both shower AND get to the office tomorrow but my brain is in overdrive. (Probably that tiny pinch of steroids injected into my bloodstream today is making sleep elusive.) It would be notable if I accomplished those amazing feats I mention above but Iâ€™d been hoping to get the same little boost I got from Ocrevus the last time (really the first time) and when Iâ€™m feeling unrealistically optimistic, I do stupid things. Things like emailing my entire staff and telling them Iâ€™m going to be focusing on getting into the office more after infusion day number 2 is in the bag. I may or may not have committed to being in the office tomorrow. The very first day after my big nearly 8 hour day at Allegheny Generalâ€™s infusion center. Not all that smart, am I? No you arenâ€™t that smart, Beth. I feel like I need to kick myself in the ass. Hit restart. I gave myself until this day, big infusion day number two, to stop believing this body simply canâ€™t operate in the outside world as a regular, if slightly ability challenged, human. Today will be over in a few hours and I feel like I have to try harder to make it happen, to stop my brain from undermining every single little thing in my life. The trick is, figuring out how to do that without trying so hard that I kick myself back into relapse again. Or fall (again). Or end up in the hospital (again). Itâ€™s really difficult to determine where that line is. My nose is still a bit purple! Itâ€™s literally as plain as the nose on my face, one might say, that pushing too far without realizing it can have dire consequences. How far is too far? I honestly donâ€™t know and that scares me. But thereâ€™s a feeling that comes over me. The feeling of a good day. I havenâ€™t had one in quite a while but it hasnâ€™t been so long that Iâ€™ve forgotten what it feels like. Itâ€™s not specific to any symptom. Itâ€™s not just how I feel when my feet hit the floor in the morning and I walk a little easier. Itâ€™s not a sudden burst of energy. Itâ€™s not a lightening bolt when you look back on the day and realize you werenâ€™t popping Advil like Skittles. Itâ€™s more like a slow realization that the pain suddenly is not quite as painful. Itâ€™s a feeling of lightness. A feeling of safety. A feeling of peace. It never lasts very long, at least not lately. But itâ€™s the good place. Those are the days when my MS is quiet. The thing I always fail to realize on a good day is that the constant noise in my head is somehow not there. It usually runs on a loop in my brain daily. â€œI canâ€™t I canâ€™t I canâ€™t I canâ€™t I canâ€™tâ€¦what if? what if? what if? what if? always always always always alwaysâ€¦ it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts I wonâ€™t I wonâ€™t I wonâ€™t I wonâ€™t I wonâ€™tâ€¦â€ Repeat. That voice allows MS to put a veil over life that makes everything slightly less vivid. Slightly less clear. Slightly less appealing. Slightly less possible. I donâ€™t know how to stop that voice. Iâ€™m probably stupid to give myself some kind of clear line in my own personal sand to test myself. To force myself into action. To present myself with an actual date. Take a shower. Leave the house. ON THE SAME DAY. Believe it works and it will work. Allow yourself not to be scared. It all sounds so inspirational and like so much bullshit. It could actually BE too hard. I might get out of the shower tomorrow and feel like my limbs are suddenly made of over cooked pasta. I might fall down when my feet hit the floor when I get out of bed. The world around me could suddenly be spinning like a crazed whirly bird. I might throw up again. I might have something entirely brand fucking new like not being able to see right or one or the other side of my entire body suddenly going completely numb. Any of that could happen. Thatâ€™s what this crazy ass messed up disease actually does to our bodies. And itâ€™s entirely unique and different for each of us. We can relate to each other (us who are in this strange club called multiple sclerosis most of whom are my digital friends, but not all). It helps to know that someone else had a similar thing happen to them that one timeâ€¦but that only goes so far. Your MS is your MS and until you look it in the face and make some kind of friends with it, every day will be a complete and utter surprise. I literally have no idea from minute to minute, second to second, moment to moment what my central nervous system has cooked up for me with her girl Friday (my immune system). I have to just accept it. I am almost two years into this mess and Iâ€™m shocked that I still havenâ€™t accepted it. Listen. Hereâ€™s the bottom line. Every day is a complete and utter surprise even for people that donâ€™t have MS. My unpredictability is almost better than theirs, all of those normals I mean, because mine has a name. Theirs is just called â€œlifeâ€ and holy shit thatâ€™s the scariest disease of all because it also changes moment by moment. I used to be one of them (a normal) and i know how I felt. I thought I knew how my life would change for a million different reasonsâ€¦I had a plan. I was reasonably smart and I worked so very hard and made such important plans. I would tell myself that by being a good, kind, loving human being I would have my happy little place in the world. Things would go my way. They had, for the most part, so it was an easy myth to believeâ€¦But I didnâ€™t know. None of us has the first fucking clue whatâ€™s going to happen on any day of the week. We just think we do. I know! Maybe when I look my named disease in the face and accept all of that chaos I will begin to accept that disease isnâ€™t always ugly. It has facets and eccentricities just like we all do. I think I know what itâ€™s going to do. Itâ€™s going to destroy me. It simply has to. Thatâ€™s why it exists! But maybe thereâ€™s more to it than that. Maybe disease can be a teacher. Maybe I can learn how to stop thinking the teacher is a mindless dolt, and start listening to her. Or maybe I canâ€™t. I honestly donâ€™t know at this point in my own personal evolution. I have no idea whatâ€™s going to happen next. And neither does anyone else. This might sound crazy but thatâ€™s the part that makes me feel better. That I know that fact to be gospel-according-to-beth-truth. We never know. We never have known. Itâ€™s always been a complete crap shoot. And it still is. Will I shower and go to work in the office tomorrow to triumph over the gauntlet I threw down for myself? The truth is, I donâ€™t know. I know I will try thatâ€™s all I know for certain. Post Script: My original plan was overly ambitious, after all. My day started today with phone calls at 7:30AM and then call after call after call until it was 3PM and I still hadnâ€™t showered or brushed my teeth. I did make some important things happen with all of those calls so it didnâ€™t feel like a failure to me. I just had to suck it up an accept that I was being overly ambitious. Itâ€™s a good thing too. Because I did finally shower around 3:30 PM and that shower kicked my MS-having ass. I never would have been able to get done what I got done today had I attempted to go into the office after an early shower, as I so foolishly planned for the day after a rough infusion experience. I know it will take some time before the new goo makes itâ€™s magic. Iâ€™m there in my head now. But now that Iâ€™m finally physically clean? Iâ€™m going to the office tomorrow. Baby steps are still steps in the right direction. Iâ€™m giving myself a much needed pass on not holding to my commitment to be there today. In the end, Iâ€™m trying. Iâ€™m trying so very hard! That has to be enough.",ocrevus,2,,,
"Leo, Wow -- that is a touch choice. I know Opdivo has FDA approval to treat small lung cell after a recurrence following conventional chemotherapy. I've not been able to find information on what advantages pairing Opdivo and Yervoy offer but I'm sure your medical oncologist will be able to provide that data. Full disclosure: I've not experienced immunotherapy treatment but have had two repeats of conventional chemotherapy (Taxol and Carboplatin). My experience with the repeated conventional therapy is it did affect tumors, eliminating 2 of 3 and it did reduce the size of the third, but it did not eliminate my stubborn tumor. My repeat radiation was actually precision radiation (CyberKnife) that fried my stubborn tumor. It looks like you have three small tumors.

"Diet and supplementation changed my life, got me off steroids for the first time in four years. I still need to remain on medication though. Iâ€™m on Vedolizumab as well as Mesalazine and Azathioprine. Itâ€™s proven the best treatment, but until I radically changed my approach to nutrition, I remained very ill.  @wingman Proctitis needs fixing, it can get bad fast and can be really, really unpleasant. I mistook it once for a terrible flair. Iâ€™ve always found Mesalazine enemas the most effective, though administration isnâ€™t pleasant. The NHS donâ€™t want to medicate you, our drugs cost a fortune, immunomodulation in particular. Unfortunately our disease is so individual, unpredictable and not well understood, that all they can do is follow a protocol of â€˜see disease > give medication > still see disease > give stronger medicationâ€™. Weâ€™re told diet isnâ€™t a big part, and I believed them for years. Now I just think they donâ€™t yet have enough information to tell patients anything else. I saw a nutritionist who told me that aside from avoiding triggers and trying VSL#3, diet had nothing to do with it. All I can say is that for myself, what goes in my body has the single greatest impact on the severity of my diseases. Unfortunately IBD still has so many question marks over it, weâ€™re very lucky we have drugs that sometimes help us avoid the dangerous procedure of having it all removed, but there are so many variables, managing is a constant balancing act.

"Itâ€™s been a strange couple of days. Iâ€™m finally able to start taking my high dose biotin again. If you read any of my other threads on biotin, and there are many, what mostly showed in the biotin is that my walking speed increased by seven seconds. This is according to my neurological test by my doctor. However Iâ€™ve stated, and I still stand by, that biotin helped do more. Besides noticing more weakness in my legs and hip area, my hands have also been giving me problems. Since I have problems with my hands all the time anyway I havenâ€™t paid much attention until yesterday when I realized they were so much worse. It got me thinking that maybe when I started taking the biotin again, they might improve too. Biotin is a vitamin. In my opinion what could it hurt to try. However Iâ€™m not a doctor so you need to check with your doctor. So Iâ€™ve been putting out there to the universe about the possibility of a companion in my life again.

But then yesterday he wrote I really love you in the contexts of not in a friendly kind of way it was said by itself. My reply was people donâ€™t talk like that and I blocked him.

"Did a quick search of long-term outcomes in RA patients treated with Rituxan and didn't find any mentions of an uptick in cancers. I'm wondering, though, if comparing Rituxamab to ocrelizumab might not be a direct comparison (certainly not as different as apples to oranges, but maybe trying to compare Macintosh apples to Golden Delicious apples). What I mean by this is that although Rituxamab and ocrelizumab are both eradicate CD20 cells, they do so with someone different mechanisms of action. It's possible that these differences account for ocrelizumab's higher efficacy, but may also contribute to its possibly more perilous safety profile. After all, the ocrelizumab RA trials had to be halted due to opportunistic infections and patient deaths, whereas Rituxan has been used successfully and safely to treat RA for 11 years now. This would seem to indicate that there is a difference in how the body reacts to these two drugs. This may be similar to Tysabri's dramatically higher risk of PML compared to other T cell drugs. Tysabri's mechanism of action certainly leads to this higher risk of PML when compared to drugs like Gilenya, but both keep T cells out of the CNS. So why the higher risk of PML with Tysabri? On a different note, Dr. G, would you be willing to be interviewed for a Wheelchair Kamikaze blog post? Would love to talk to you about therapeutic lag and its implications for treating progressive MS patients. We could do a short telephone interview (I can call you), and I can run the transcript as a blog post, thereby allowing you to explain the theory ""straight from the horses mouth"". We could also talk about other topics if you are so inclined. I think this would be of tremendous value to my readers, and would give your theory some wider exposure among the patient population, which it certainly deserves.

"Anne, I'm sorry to hear about your lung cancer diagnosis and your broken femur - what an ordeal to have to go thru! Are the mets in your leg bone and vertebrae new since beginning treatment? I am assuming your most recent PET scan is a follow up to a more recent one that served as a base line???? My mom received 6 sessions of carbo+alimta+Keytruda for her lung cancer recurrence. She then continued with Keytruda only for nearly a year. It worked well for her, she is a great candidate for Keytruda because her PD-L1 level is more than 90%. She has had no evidence of disease for nearly a year (keep your fingers crossed for her, we are receiving her latest CT results in a few hours). Like Tom said, weird things can pop up early into treatment with immunotherapy. PET scans show active areas, that's why our organs light up - they are active. As Tom said, the ""activity"" in your leg could be due to the active healing process. But only time will tell. My mom was on the ""wait and see"" program too, most are. She had to ""wait and see"" prior to her initial diagnosis to see if her lung nodules grew and now she is on the ""wait and see"" between scans to hopefully show that the cancer has not returned. It's a horrible part of the disease. But you are in great hands with immunotherapy...it does great things for lots of people! Give it some time to get to work.

BACKGROUND: No treatments have been approved for primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod, an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, is effective in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis, but has not been assessed in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. We assessed the safety and efficacy of fingolimod in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In INFORMS, a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study, patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis recruited across 148 centres in 18 countries were randomly allocated (1:1) with computer-generated blocks to receive oral fingolimod or placebo for at least 36 months and a maximum of 5 years. Patients were initially assigned to fingolimod 1Â·25 mg per day or placebo (cohort 1); however, after a protocol amendment on Nov 19, 2009, patients were switched in a masked manner to fingolimod 0Â·5 mg, whereas those on placebo continued on matching placebo. From then onwards, patients were assigned to receive fingolimod 0Â·5 mg/day or placebo (cohort 2). Key inclusion criteria were age 25-65 years, clinical diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis, 1 year or more of disease progression, and two of the following criteria: positive brain MRI; positive spinal cord MRI; or positive cerebrospinal fluid. Additional eligibility criteria included disease duration of 2-10 years and objective evidence of disability progression in the previous 2 years. Patients and study investigators were masked to group assignment. We used a novel primary composite endpoint based on change from baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), 25' Timed-Walk Test, or Nine-Hole Peg Test to assess time to 3-month confirmed disability progression in study participants treated for at least 3 years. All randomised patients took at least one dose of study drug. The primary efficacy analysis included all patients in cohort 2 and those assigned to placebo in cohort 1. The safety analysis included all patients in cohorts 1 and 2. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00731692. The study is now closed. FINDINGS: 970 patients were randomly assigned between Sept 3, 2008, and Aug 30, 2011 (147 to fingolimod 1Â·25 mg and 133 to placebo in cohort 1; 336 to fingolimod 0Â·5 mg and 354 to placebo in cohort 2). The efficacy analysis set (n=823) consisted of 336 patients randomly allocated to fingolimod 0Â·5 mg and 487 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups and representative of a primary progressive multiple sclerosis population (48% women, mean age 48Â·5 years [SD 8Â·4], mean EDSS 4Â·67 [SD 1Â·03], 87% free of gadolinium-enhancing lesions). By end of study, 3-month confirmed disability progression had occurred in 232 and 338 patients in the fingolimod and placebo groups, respectively, resulting in Kaplan-Meier estimates of 77Â·2% (95% CI 71Â·87-82Â·51) of patients in the fingolimod group versus 80Â·3% (73Â·31-87Â·25) of patients in the placebo group (risk reduction 5Â·05%; hazard ratio 0Â·95, 95% CI 0Â·80-1Â·12; p=0Â·544). Safety results were generally consistent with those of studies of fingolimod in patients with relapse-onset multiple sclerosis. Lymphopenia occurred in 19 (6%) patients in the fingolimod group versus none in the placebo group, bradycardia in five (1%) versus one (<1%), and first-degree atrioventricular block in three (1%) versus six (1%). Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients in the fingolimod group and 117 (24%) in the placebo group, including macular oedema in six (2%) versus six (1%), and basal-cell carcinoma in 14 (4%) versus nine (2%). INTERPRETATION: The anti-inflammatory effects of fingolimod did not slow disease progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Therapeutic strategies for primary progressive multiple sclerosis might need different approaches to those used for relapse-onset multiple sclerosis. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma AG.",fingolimod,2,,,
"Heeeey my fellow chronies, i'm Julian from Australia, Melbourne and 21 years old. This is my first time posting here, and i'm desperately in need of some advice with how i should approach this. Before i started remicade i was taking azathiorpine and allopurinol. My gastro doctor told me i have a severe case of crohns disease based off my inflammation via colonoscopy , and my crp levels being around the 80 mark, and Faecal calprotectin being just a little over 1000. My results did not change with this treatment so my doctor was considering remicade because i was battling severe malnutrition, and all the other nasty common symptoms of crohns disease. I was then put on remicade because of how desperate i was, and oh has it been a ""miracle drug"" for me. It has been 17 months and im almost in complete remission with scopes, crp and faecal calprotectin levels all back to normal and clear. I have experienced little side effects with remicade, so i consider myself lucky. For the first couple of months my doctor recommend i take remicade with a 6mp, because it prevents your body from building antibodies sooner, but this combo effected my liver levels, and my doctor wanted to have a mri of my liver, and found a mild case of PSC (Primary sclerosing cholangitis) a form of liver disease. My doctor took my off 6mp, and my liver levels went straight back to normal, so i stayed on remicade alone. It has truly worked wonders for me and i cant be more thankful for it so far. But i cant help but think about the scary side effects of taking this medication long term. Which bring me back to the title of this thread, im almost in complete remission with my scopes results being clear as normal and with no symptoms. I was hoping i could talk to my doctor about lowering the dose just to minimize risks of long term use of remicade or another alternative someone can give me here . anyone that can reply to this, it would be greatly appreciated, god bless everyone battling this terrible disease.",remicade,0,,,
@me1123 Hi sorry to hear you are going through the shock of your diagnosis. As others have said give yourself time to come to terms with it. When I was diagnosed almost 24 years ago I was in denial and I had the attitude if I forget about it it might go away. It did for the best part of 20 years until I got a relapse. I put a lot of this this down to stress so definitely try to avoid that. I was put on Betaferon the year after I was as diagnosed and this helped to control it. I have been on Gileny since September 2016 and my Ms has been stable since. It is a good DMT and very easy to take compared to having to inject myself. If you need anymore info on Gilenya let me know. Take care. X,gilenya,2,,,

"It is a fallacious argument to imply that working for you and someone else you know means that it works for all. Conversely that side effects listed or experienced by you or someone you know are a reason for someone, whose medical history and circumstances you are unfamiliar with, are going to experience the same. @orlando27 â€“ for the less enlightened amongst us, perhaps you could expand on the sources for your claims. Are you referring to this 2010 paper by Jones et al? http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/8/2232 And six years on there is a rounder view emerging. This doesnâ€™t say Lemtrada or Gilyena are bad, but puts some more context around them. It is broadly good In the Journal â€˜Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safetyâ€™ [Sage â€“ 2012] there is a more recently paper entitled â€˜Benefits versus risks of latest therapies in multiple sclerosis: a perspective reviewâ€™ . There is this pre-license 2013 article http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629751/ And so on and so forth. The point is that context is everything. Alemtuzumab is a good drug in the right circumstances and if the patient meets the right criteria. There are plenty of things that make a patient unsuitable. Likewise for Gilenya. I believe there was a recent post from the admins about advocating a particular course of action. Have a good evening. Best, Dom",gilenya,2,,,
"KW202, Since your neuro doesnâ€™t prescribe injectables there is little to comment on regarding them but to say the older drugs were approved when there was nothing else available. There is a legitimate questionâ€¦ if they came to market today would they get FDA approval? Certainly questionable. You asked a good question... how long people are recommended to stay on Tysabri, if JCV negative? Biogen doesnâ€™t make treatment recommendations, those decisions are doctor-patient domain and will vary with individual circumstances. One of the popular but false internet rumors was, â€œBiogen doesnâ€™t recommend staying on Tysabri beyond two yearsâ€. I called Biogen and they told me Biogen does not make treatment recommendations. So that rumor is false. You asked how long people stay on Tysabri if JCV negativeâ€¦ there is no standard length of time. The JC virus causes PML. If you do not have JC virus you cannot and will not get PML. BUT you can have a false negative test, and that does happen. In other words, the JCV antibody titer can be below .2 (the threshold for negative is below .2; the range between .2 and .4 is indeterminate of being positive or negative, btw) but even below .2 (negative) some people were found who did have JC viremia present. And, there have been a couple people who tested as JCV negative who did get PML, I believe. Obviously, these were positive (remember the JC virus alone causes PML) but they tested negative, a false negative. Please ask your neuro about this, ok? Out of approx. 140,000 the chance of testing negative for JCV and getting PML is quite small. Keep in mind that you get tested every few months on Tysabri so the chances of having a fluke test (testing negative but actually being positive) is diminished. To me, a test may be off once but unlikely to be off in all subsequent consecutive tests. A negative test several times in a row would be sufficient proof for me that I was negative. Fall of 2015 the stats were about 140,000 people who had taken Tysabri and about 600 developed PML; about 150 of those (about 25%) died as a result of PML. Again, check with your doctor. Does risk change if over time you are JCV negative? Interesting question because over time, as an element of aging and exposure people can change from JCV- to JCV+. Nothing unusual about it; as you get older you have more exposure possibility to infections (JCV is of unknown origin) of every type, not just JCV. But you cannot get PML if you are JCV- and remain so. Second you asked about Tysabri being a med MSers are put on after failing other therapies. Yes, often that is the case but not always. Treatment philosophy comes into play here. Some neuros want to be aggressive right away and stop MS in its tracks as soon as possible. Other neuros, prefer to wait and see if MS gets bad before going to a higher risk â€“ higher reward DMT like Tysabri. Obviously, the patientâ€™s personal risk profile has to be factored in. Can you sleep with the decision you make? It has got to pass your sleep test, not your neuro's! Perhaps, your neuro sees or suspects your MS is highly active and wants to treat it aggressively. Be sure to ask and talk about why she leans toward Tysabri. Third, out-ofâ€“pocket costâ€¦ Biogen has a co-pay assistance program. Almost everyone qualifies for $100 toward the medicine and another $100 for the infusion. It used to be that you had to make less than 100K per year but it is even higher now, Iâ€™m sure. Just call Biogen and they can fill you in; then you will have it straight. With our insurance, our co-pay is $110. Biogen pays $100 of that. They also assist with $100 toward infusion cost. Be sure to call Biogen and ask about their assistance program, most states allow it but Iâ€™ve heard a couple do not. Fourth, can coming off Tysabri trigger relapse? Yes, it can and does in some (but not all by any means!) instances. But techniques to mitigate or eliminate that are being developed. It used to be that a long washout was standard before going on another medicine. However, it has been found that the shorter the wash out period, the less likely relapse will occur. Lastly, I would say that Tysabri is tremendously effective in slowing disease progression. My wife has been on Tysabri since 2002 except for a period in 2005-2006 when it was off market due to PML concerns. She is in remarkably good health and has been JCV positive since the first test for JCV was developed a few years ago. The major technique to de-risk for PML since she is JCV+ is to extend time between doses. The theory is that Tysabri diminishes in saturation over time which allows more immune surveillance against the JC virus. So far, as of last fall there were zero cases of PML in about 900 MSers going 5,6,7, or 8 weeks between infusions and there were 4 cases of PML in the control group (about the same number) on standard dosing of 4 weeks. So, it appears as though extending time between doses is beneficial but the trial is ongoing and some neuros will not change clinical practice until the data is published, peer-reviewed and adopted. Possibly, people with highly active MS may not be able to go beyond 4 weeks. Also, there is little need to go beyond 4 weeks in the first two years on Tysabri whether you are JCV+ or negative because the PML risk is very low during the first two years of treatment. Iâ€™m sure you have seen charts on estimated PML risk. If not, you might want to Google â€œBartâ€™s MS research blogâ€ and find the PML risk chart there. If you do go to that site, also please check out the â€œCharcot 2â€ project. They are seeking a viral cause for MS and need our consideration of support. Tysabri has risk of PML but MS, also, has huge risk if it is not treated effectively. Treatment is a decision each doctor-patient should make together. Those opting out of the all FDA approved meds should be educating themselves about LDN (low-dose naltrexone), IMO. Last thoughtâ€¦ Ocrelizumab is a new, very impressive med that has been through Phase 3 trials and is likely to get FDA approval late 2016 or thereabouts. Some neuros may choose a med like Tysabri knowing it presents little risk of PML during the first two years and plan to switch to ocrelizumab when it becomes available; or, they may want to stick with Tysabri which has a proven and superb track record of effectiveness with little PML risk if a patient remains JCV-. In patients Iâ€™ve seen and spoken with regularly for more than 10 years at the infusion center side effects on Tysabri are largely non-existent. That is only my personal observation, please discuss side effects with your doctor. Others on Tysabri will hopefully offer their experiences in this thread, also. Many MSers who are JCV+ choose to remain on Tysabri accepting the risk of PML because Tysabri has halted disease progression for them. Just my thoughts. Best!",ocrelizumab,0,,,

"New diabetes and diabetic retinopathy research indicates that people with type 2 diabetes, who intensively controlled their blood sugar levels during the landmark A ction to C ontrol C ardiovascular R isk in D iabetes (ACCORD) Trial Eye Study, cut their risk of diabetic retinopathy in half in a follow-up analysis, called the ACCORD Follow-on Eye Study (ACCORDION), which was conducted four years after stopping the intensive blood sugar control regimen required by the ACCORD Trial. ""This study sends a powerful message to people with type 2 diabetes who worry about losing vision,"" said Dr. Emily Chew, study co-author and deputy director of the National Eye Institute's Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications. ""Well-controlled glycemia, or blood sugar level, has a positive, measurable, and lasting effect on eye health."" Please note, however, that there are cautionary issues and unresolved causative factors related to the blood sugar (glycemic) control group in the original ACCORD study (discussed below) that readers should evaluate carefully and discuss with their physicians .  About the Research from Diabetes Care This new diabetic retinopathy research, entitled Persistent Effects of Intensive Glycemic Control on Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetes in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Follow-On Study , has been published in the July 2016 edition of Diabetes Care , a peer-reviewed journal published monthly by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Diabetes Care is a journal for health care practitioners that is intended to increase knowledge, stimulate research, and promote better management of people with diabetes . The authors are Emily Chew, MD, from the National Eye Institute; the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Follow-On (ACCORDION) Eye Study Group ; and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Follow-On (ACCORDION) Study Group .  Some Explanations and Terminology The ACCORD Trial The ACCORD Trial (2003-2009) involved 77 study sites across North America and enrolled 10,251 participants, all with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the ACCORD Trial was to test three treatment strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease among people with longstanding type 2 diabetes: (1) maintaining near-normal blood sugar levels (intensive glycemic control); (2) improving blood lipid levels, such as lowering LDL ""bad"" cholesterol and triglycerides and raising HDL ""good"" cholesterol; and (3) lowering blood pressure. [Editor's note: The treatment phase of the glycemic (blood sugar) control portion of ACCORD had been planned to last 5.6 years but was stopped at 3.5 years, due to an increase in death among participants in the intensive glycemic control group. Analyses thus far have not determined a specific cause for these increased deaths. However, the benefits of intensive glycemic therapy must be weighed against the potential risks â€“ most notably the increased risk of death observed in the ACCORD Trial.] The ACCORD Trial Eye Study analyzed a subset of 2,856 Trial participants who had not received laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy and who had data from the beginning through year four of the study. ACCORD was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, with collaborators from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; the National Institute on Aging; the National Eye Institute; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can read more about the ACCORD Trial at The National Institutes of Health and Clinical Trials.gov .  The ACCORDION Follow-on Eye Study ACCORDION (2010-2014) is a follow-up assessment of diabetic retinopathy progression in 1,310 people who participated in ACCORD. ACCORDION re-assessed diabetic retinopathy approximately four years after the intensive glycemic control portion of the study had ended, and eight years after enrollment in ACCORD. By that time, the average A1c (see explanation below) was 7.8 percent for the intensive therapy group and 7.9 percent for the standard therapy group. However, diabetic retinopathy had advanced in only 5.8 percent of participants in the intensive therapy group since enrollment in ACCORD, compared to 12.7 percent in the standard therapy group. ACCORDION was funded through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.  Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes (formerly called adult-onset, Type II, or non-insulin dependent) has the following characteristics: It usually occurs after age 30 and affects 90%-95% of individuals with diabetes. It occurs if (1) the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (insulin deficiency), (2) the body's cells are not able to use insulin correctly and efficiently (insulin resistance), or (3) both conditions are present. Glucose continues to rise in the bloodstream because sufficient levels of insulin are not available to open the cells and allow glucose to enter. Initially, it can be managed with weight loss, physical activity, and effective meal planning. For some individuals this suffices for a period of time; when the disease progresses, however, oral medication or insulin may also be required. Primary risk factors include increasing age (45+); ethnic background (African-American, Latino, Native American, Asian); family history; and obesity. You can learn more at  What Is Diabetes? .  The A1c Test The A1c blood test, also known as glycated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, and HbA1c, is the primary tool used to diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetes and to monitor blood glucose control in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This test enables health care providers to diagnose diabetes and treat it before complications occur and to diagnose pre-diabetes to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes. You can read more about the established A1c levels used to diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetes at Diabetes and the Significance of the A1c Test .  About the Research Excerpted from Intense diabetes treatment prevents damage to vision at United Press International : Intense treatment of diabetes can help prevent damage to blood vessels in the retina that often leads to blindness, according to a long-term study by the National Institutes of Health. Researchers used aggressive treatment to maintain glycemic control, blood lipid levels and blood pressure, cutting the risk for developing diabetic retinopathy in half, they reported. The researchers stopped the portion focused on glycemic control 3.5 years into a planned 5.6-year test because of an increase in death among participants, though patients being treated for blood pressure and blood lipid levels continued for the rest of the intended test period. Tight control of the condition improved health of patients, but did not reduce risk for cardiovascular disease. The treatment did, however, reduce the progress of retinopathy by about one-third. For the new study, the researchers re-examined 1,310 patients who took part in the original ACCORD study to measure the progression of participants' retinopathy four years after treatment concluded. While measures of blood glucose between participants who received intensive and standard care remained similar to the end of the previous study, 5.8 percent of participants had seen advancement in their retinopathy â€“ less than half the 12.7 percent of those receiving standard treatment whose condition progressed.  More about Diabetic Eye Disease Diabetic Retinopathy Although people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts at a younger age and are twice as likely to develop glaucoma as people who do not have diabetes, the primary vision problem caused by diabetes is diabetic retinopathy , the leading cause of new cases of blindness and low vision in adults aged 20-65:   What a person with diabetic retinopathy may see ""Retinopathy"" is a general term that describes damage to the retina. The  retina is a thin, light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside surface of the eye. Nerve cells in the retina convert incoming light into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are carried by the optic nerve to the brain, which interprets them as visual images. Diabetic retinopathy occurs when there is damage to the small blood vessels that nourish tissue and nerve cells in the retina. ""Proliferative"" is a general term that means to grow or increase at a rapid rate by producing new tissue or cells. When the term ""proliferative"" is used in relation to diabetic retinopathy, it describes the growth, or proliferation, of abnormal new blood vessels in the retina. ""Non-proliferative"" indicates that this process is not yet occurring. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy affects approximately 1 in 20 individuals with the disease.  Four Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy According to the National Eye Institute , diabetic retinopathy has four stages:  Mild non-proliferative retinopathy: At this early stage, small areas of balloon-like swelling occur in the retina's tiny blood vessels.  Moderate non-proliferative retinopathy: As the disease progresses, some blood vessels that nourish the retina become blocked.  Severe non-proliferative retinopathy: Many more blood vessels become blocked, which disrupts the blood supply that nourishes the retina. The damaged retina then signals the body to produce new blood vessels.  Proliferative retinopathy: At this advanced stage, signals sent by the retina trigger the development of new blood vessels that grow (or proliferate) in the retina and the vitreous, which is a transparent gel that fills the interior of the eye. Because these new blood vessels are abnormal, they can rupture and bleed, causing hemorrhages in the retina or vitreous. Scar tissue can develop and can tug at the retina, causing further damage or even retinal detachment.  More about the Study from Diabetes Care Condensed and excerpted from the article summary and conclusion, with the full article available online: Our results showed that intensive glycemic control conferred enduring protection from progression of diabetic retinopathy even though the glycated hemoglobin levels were similar 8 years after randomization and about 4 years after the cessation of the clinical trial. This is the first study in people with type 2 diabetes of about 10 years' duration and established cardiovascular disease, unlike the newly diagnosed participants in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), that demonstrated this effect. This phenomenon has been called ""metabolic memory"" or ""legacy effect"" in the studies of type 1 diabetes. The ACCORDION findings demonstrate a similar legacy effect of intensive glycemia control on the progression of retinal disease in people with established type 2 diabetes. Moreover, this effect occurred in response to a median of 3.7 years of intensive glycemic control, and was observed in people with type 2 diabetes and additional cardiovascular risk factors, whose mean diabetes duration was 10 years, and whose initial mean HbA1c was 8.2%. These observations suggest that glucose lowering can reduce progression of retinal disease relatively late in the course of diabetes and that the retina responds to relatively short-term changes in glucose levels. Whether an even shorter period of glucose lowering could achieve a similar long-term effect on the eyes in either type 2 or type 1 diabetes remains unknown.  In summary, our study results provide evidence that intensive glycemic control is beneficial for reducing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and that the legacy effect is evident in people with type 2 diabetes. The addition of the ACCORDION retinal results to these prior findings demonstrates a posttreatment benefit of intensive glycemia control on the progression of eye, kidney, and nerve disease.",vitrectomy,2,,,

"UPDATE: I saw IBD Specialist yesterday for my first follow-up after my colonoscopy on May 2nd (3 weeks ago). Let me rewind and say that I have been stressing about this appointment, afraid IBD Specialist would give me options I didn't like and then bully me to pick one. I have been waiting for test results and honestly looking more and more at surgery. I tried to drop from 40mg to 35mg prednisone last Monday and it was awful. I had horrible withdrawal symptoms and started bleeding. That was very defeating and I knew it was a bad sign. I went back up to 40mg and stabilized. Actually not doing too bad--having BM's every day (this requires dulcolax though) and not too much blood. My tenesmus is much better and I haven't taken any bentyl in over a week. I'm still fatigued but managing to live my life despite it--albeit--my house is messy because somethings gotta give. It's great that my symptoms have improved but since I'm dependent on the prednisone + humira + cortifoam, it really can't be considered a ""win"". Here are things we considered when discussing my treatment plan: 1. I am TPMT ""normal"" and CAN metabolize 6MP & Imuran--so these drugs became an option for me. 2. I do not have antibodies to Humira--BUT 3. My Humira serum levels were very low (they were 2) and IBD Specialist crinkled her nose and said ""That's not doing anything for you"". 4. Because my Humira levels are so low, I wouldn't have to wait any amount of time to start a new biologic, if that's what we decided. 5. So here are the options we discussed: A. Humira + Imuran B. Remicaid + Imuran (if I don't have antibodies) C. Stelara + Imuran D. Entyvio + Imuran E. Diverting colostomy (temp until I heal) F. Permanent colostomy We discussed the pro's and con's of each treatment. I waited patiently for IBD Specialist to finish making her flow chart and explaining everything to me, before I asked questions and gave input. My first question was ""Am I a candidate for a j-pouch?"" And I knew her answer would be ""No"", which was correct. I immediately eliminated the option of a diverting colostomy, stating that if I was going to do surgery then I would choose the permanent surgery, since that's ultimately what I want... Though I am disappointed that the j-pouch is not an option, I was happy when IBD Specialist said that surgery IS a very good option for me. Since I have never shown inflammation outside the colon, she said the chances of me developing disease elsewhere is maybe 2% and that after surgery I would not need to take any meds anymore! Woot! Ultimately I want a med-free, disease-free life, so that is very encouraging. I could live the life I want to live with an ostomy--barring complications. But I'm not ready for surgery yet. I told her ""I've been researching and reading peoples' stories, and I'm encouraged because even people who have complications tend to be happy they had the surgery. I was afraid of recovery time but I see that most people feel better immediately and are active within a week or so after surgery. However... I'm having trouble getting excited about it. I want to feel good about it, but I'm still struggling to imagine life with an ostomy and I am scared of complications--if it didn't turn out the way I planned"". IBD Specialist totally understood. I told her I like the Humira because I do think it has helped me--I was much worse on steroids alone--and I like that I have no side effects. I have been wanting to try adding 6MP/Imuran to see if that can help me wean from the prednisone. So Humira + Imuran is my first choice. She said ok, no problem. We eliminated Remicaid altogether because my response to it wasn't that good--I still had to use Rowasa enemas. If the Humira + Imuran doesn't allow me to get off prednisone, we chose Stelara + Imuran as my next drug therapy, mostly because Stelara works more quickly than Entyvio. But... I am considering just going straight to an ostomy if the Humira + Imuran fails. It really just depends on how things go... Something ""clicked"" during this visit. When I got in my car to leave I didn't cry or feel scared or confused. I felt relieved. Because surgery isn't sounding so bad. I am starting to have a positive vision of my life with an ostomy. My family is going on vacation from June 4-10th and I asked her to keep things stable until I returned because I want to enjoy it. IBD Specialist said ""Of course"" and told me to just add the Imuran but don't worry about dropping the prednisone until I get back. I appreciated that. I will have blood drawn for monitoring on June 2nd and then I will see IBD Specialist on June 16th and have blood drawn again. I need to get a flu shot and a pneumonia vaccination. I am nervous about getting on a plane and also going to Disneyland (remember the measles outbreak?) while on 40mg prednisone + humira + imuran. On the other hand...my immune system is relentless and I'm physically pretty strong right now so chances are good that I will be fine. But any suggestions on how to stay healthy while traveling are appreciated.

"Osimertinib demonstrated better clinically-meaningful efficacy and a well-characterized safety profile compared to platinum pemetrexed among patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following progression on EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, according to results presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 17 th Annual World Conference on Lung Cancer in Austria. 1 Osimertinib is a potent, irreversible, central nervous system (CNS)-active, EGFR-TKI selective for sensitizing (EGFRm) and T790M resistance mutations. Osimertinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC. The authors presented results of the AURA3 ( NCT02151981 ) trial, a phase 3, open-label, randomized study assessing the efficacy and safety of osimertinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy plus pemetrexed among patients with EGFR T790M-positive advanced NSCLC. Four hundred and nineteen patients were randomized to either receive osimertinib (279 patients) or platinum-pemetrexed (140 patients). Sixty-four percent of the patients were female, 65% Asian, 68% never smoker, 34% with CNS metastases, and 66% with EGFR exon 19 deletion. Patients treated with osimertinib had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 10.1 months, compared with 4.4 months for patients treated with platinum-pemetrexed. The objective response rate (ORR) was also improved among patients treated with osimertinib (71%) compared to platinum-pemetrexed (31%). Median duration of response was 9.7 months with osimertinib and 4.1 months with platinum-pemetrexed.  RELATED: Tumor, Node, and Metastasis Classification: 8th Edition Changes Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were reported in 6% (16) of patients treated with osimertinib and 34% (46) treated with platinum-pemetrexed. The most common AEs in the group treated with osimertinib were diarrhea and rash. The authors concluded that the results establish a new standard of care for these patients.

Otherwise, Carbo/Alimta, CK, and LITT.  However, being that the brain mets are growing, I am scheduled for fractionated CK on July 12,13, and 14 (for the brain met close to the optic nerve), and Laser Intersticial Thermal Therapy (LITT) for the 9mm brain met.  Today, I received my Tagrisso, but unfortunately will not be able to do the echo until Wednesday.  I am in very good health, otherwise.  My questions are: 1. Should I start Tagrisso tomorrow Saturday? I do not want to wait anymore. (BTW, I have not stopped my Tarceva (75mg).  I will not be able to do the echocardiogram until Wednesday. 2. Being that the doctor still feels I have slow progression, am I taking a big risk trying to give Tagrisso a chance, when we have not been able to establish my T790M status?  The only place where we could actually be able to do a tissue biopsy is on one of the lymph nodes but it is located between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  My other option is to start chemo, but I am so reluctant to do that. Thanks! Faith   		This topic was modified 1 year, 9 months ago by Â faithaboveall.

"Over the past few of weeks, warnings have been issued about side effects of two MS treatments. First, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned about a â€œslightâ€ risk of seriously worsening MS symptoms if someone who is using the disease-modifying therapy Gilenya ( fingolimod ) stops using it. The FDAâ€™s alert said the worsening symptoms could â€œresult in permanent disability,â€ but the alert failed to provide details about how rare these problems are. About a week later, the FDA issued another warning . This one was about Lemtrada ( alemtuzumab ). The risk is a severe stroke that may involve tears in arteries in the neck and head. In this case, however, the FDA was specific about how many strokes had been reported by people treated with Lemtrada and when they occurred: â€œIn nearly 5 years since FDA approved Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) in 2014 to treat relapsing MS, we identified 13 worldwide cases of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and cervicocephalic arterial dissection . These 13 cases reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database occurred within 3 days of administration of the drug to patients with MS. Ten of the cases occurred in the U.S. and three occurred in Europe.â€ The FDA went on to say that it didnâ€™t have enough information for it to fully assess individual risk factors, but â€œthe occurrence of these adverse events within one day of Lemtrada administration suggests an association.â€  Knee-jerk reactions? Unsurprisingly, there was a quick response to this news on social media sites. Some of it came from people treated with Lemtrada who reported that they were among those who suffered strokes following, or during, their treatment. Their comments generated others, many of them along the lines of, â€œI wish Iâ€™d known about this before my treatment,â€ or, â€œNow, Iâ€™m not sure that I want to use this treatment.â€ But others cautioned restraint, saying there are side effects with every medication. These writers also reminded us that there are several side effects that have been much more frequently reported with Lemtrada. I wrote about the Gilenya warning a few days after it was issued, similarly advising that â€œall disease-modifying treatments have the possibility of side effects, and some are more serious than others. We who use the treatments should always be doing so with our eyes wide open and fully informed of the risks.â€  MS treatment benefits outweigh risks for me Shortly after that I wrote a post to bring everyone up to date on my own experience with Lemtrada. (Iâ€™m at eight months past round two.) Iâ€™m pleased to say itâ€™s been positive. We all know, or should know, that these DMTs carry a certain level of risk. Itâ€™s up to us, in consultation with our neurologists, to make a serious risk-benefit analysis before we start any treatment. We should proceed only if we believe the benefit outweighs the risk. We also must be willing to accept the risk if a problem occurs. One other thing: We need to be sure to read beyond the headlines of the warnings that we receive. Be sure to read the full alert so you can get a complete picture of the magnitude of the concern. If you think about it, we probably run a higher risk of incurring a serious disability each time we get into an automobile than we do from using a medication thatâ€™s designed to prevent our disability from becoming worse.

"Reply posted for Hippopostrous. Remicade is one of the several biologics. There are two types of approaches to medication. There is the bottom up therapy, where you take lighter drugs such as mesalmine, and work your way up. The other is the top down approach where doctors prescribe biologics as a first line of treatment to avoid complications in the future. I am on Remicade, and it has been a lifesaver. I was struggling for a year to find the right medication to put me in remission and this is the medication that did. If you are still unsure, talk to your child's doctor and see what they think.

"Hello Grace: It has been a while since I have posted, but I am sad to report that we lost my wife (Maria) in June to her nearly 7 year battle with stage IV NSCLC.  I can not say enough good things about the inspiring care she received from Dr. Hensing and his Team at the Northshore University Health System near Chicago and Dr. Sequist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, not to mention the support and guidance we received from GRACE.  Everyone was tremendous and so giving for those of us in this universe. In Mariaâ€™s case, she was diagnosed at stage IV with multiple sites of spread in 2010.  Yet, she beat the illness for a long time, thanks in large part to a 5 year, 3 month response to Tarceva.  Our son actually thanked Genentech at her memorial service. Now, I have a new question regarding my wifeâ€™s brother in Mexico, who was also diagnosed with EGFR+ (Exon 19 del) stage IV NSCLC about 3 three years ago (with brain mets).  He had a two year stint on Afatinib, and after progression (he is T790M negative) has relied on radiation and now a combination of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed to fight the disease.

"@firefrau26 â€“ get your neurologist to talk you through the data on brain atrophy for both drugs. If that is what you want to treat, you need to fully understand the potential for both drugs to alter the course of brain atrophy once it has already started. Lemtrada is the best available drug for preventing brain atrophy, but that assumes that it was given before the brain atrophy had started. I do not know much about the data for Ocrevus, but as it has an effect on progressive MS it is likely to be altering the course of brain atrophy once it has already begun.

"Hello. Greetings everyone. Newbie here. I was diagnosed NSCLC in December 2017 when a lung mass was discovered on a PET scan which was done for a workup of a GYN malignancy. I had no symptoms. A mass of 1.5 by 2 cm in my R lung with hilar and mediatinal nodes, a supraclvicular node, and gastrohepatic nodes. It was adenocarcinoma with no mutations but 100%PD-L1. The gastrohepatic nodes turned out to be neuroendocrine tissue but they still staged me as IV. Onward. Got the port. MRI of brain negative. Three cycles of Carbo/Alimta/Keytruda. Did OK until after the third treatment when I developed Dermatomyositis. This is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome which can come from the underlying malignancy but in my case was felt to be an autoimmune side effect of the Keytruda. Everything was stopped and I was hospitalized a couple of times. Got high dose IV steroids, mycophenolate, and IV gammaglobulin to reverse the effects of the Keytruda. Several months of rehab later I got better. Still have some muscle issues from the myopathy but much better. Anyway. My last 3 cat scans have been NED except for a mass which has been stable and they believe is pseudotumor. My second opinion oncologist (NCI cancer center) also feels the same and does not see the need for any furthur treatment at this time either. Don't really have any questions but was wondering if anyone else has seen an overwhelming respone to immunotherapy and then gotten to NED. My oncologist is optimistic that I may have a prolonged response. My GYN cancer for which I had surgery also seems to be NED. I guess I am skeptical... but grateful none the less.

You can see from my profile that things have been going very well despite the fact that I have stage four. Anyway, what Iâ€™m dealing with is pain and swelling in my knee joints.

"Dear Jim and onthemark, Thank you so much for your kind words. onthemark, as to my wifeâ€™s maintenance of energy and activity, I can mostly attribute that to her amazing spirit, focus, and resourcefulness.  When she first found out about the diagnosis she looked at me and said â€œI plan on living for many years yetâ€ â€“ and I have learned that when she gets a great idea in her head you never stand in her way! The Carboplatin hit pretty hard, plummeting the RBCs to almost (but not quite) the point of needing a transfusion, and the WBCs enough to need neulasta.  But outside of the 2-3 worst days each treatment, she still pretty much did everything she normally does.  The opdivo was probably most difficult â€“ it had no effect and caused colitis.  Nonetheless, she just took whatever medications she needed to, and we still traveled to Israel in the midst of the opdivo treatment.  And 1.5 years later, when we went to the Galapagos, she still hiked faster than I did! (Did I mention how she is amazing). We have been lucky (if you can call it that) in that at diagnosis it was near as early Stage 4 as one could get (based on the initial CT scan the pulmunologist thought it was Stage 1).  A main lung tumor, a couple of lymph nodes, and two bone metastases.  Just past calling it â€œoligometastaticâ€.  But, the second effective treatment, the clinical trial drug, kept the cancer at bay for 1.5 years, and had virtually no effect on RBC or WBC, so her energy levels improved, at the expense of some neuropathy (still present but greatly reduced after she finished that drug).  The Gemzar is working well, allowing the neuropathy to improve, but at the expense of phlebitis until she had a port put in (now no problem!).  Basically she does whatever she needs to and then gets on with life.  I am incredibly lucky to be her spouse. And I had to take many deep breaths today.

"As we age, our eyes age with us. According to the Vision Council of America , an industry trade organization, 1 in 28 Americans age 40 and older have some type of visual impairment. Vision loss and decreased eye function can make life challenging, limiting a person's independence and mobility. Impaired vision puts you at risk for other serious health conditions, as well as accidents and falls. Seniors with vision and eye problems are 200 percent more likely to be involved in motor vehicle accidents , for example. So it's important to be aware of how aging may affect your vision, which symptoms can signal a serious eye condition, and when to seek help from an ophthalmologist or other eye specialist. Here's a rundown of the conditions to look for.  1 Cataracts: Cloudy Eye Lenses   PHOTO CREDIT: Science Photo Library/Getty Images According to the National Eye Institute , more than half of seniors over age 80 suffer from cataracts , which are the most common cause of blindness in the world. Cataracts involve the clouding of the lens. This area of the eyes is made up mostly of water and protein, and as a person ages, proteins in the eyes may start to collect and cloud vision. Some people develop cataracts as a result of smoking or as a side effect of diabetes. Unfortunately, everyone develops cataracts as they age. Cataracts aren't preventable, but they're highly treatable with surgery. The surgery is quick, relatively painless, and typically performed on an outpatient basis. It involves replacing the clouded lens with an artificial intraocular lens.  2 Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)   PHOTO CREDIT: Nucleus Medical Art/Getty Images This chronic eye disease affects more than 2 million Americans age 50 and older, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology . Macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss among Americans over 65. The condition is characterized by damage to the macula, the part of the eye that's necessary for seeing objects clearly. There are two forms of the disease: dry macular degeneration and wet macular degeneration. The majority of seniors have ""dry"" macular degeneration, caused by the gradual thinning of the macula. About 10 percent of patients develop the ""wet"" form of the disease, in which abnormal blood vessels may leak blood or fluid from under the retina, causing more damage to central vision. Treatment for dry macular degeneration is limited, though nutritional supplements can often slow the progression of the disease. For wet macular degeneration, patients are treated with injections of drugs, such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept, which stops the growth of blood vessels. Laser eye surgery has also been shown to be effective.  3 Diabetic Eye Disease   PHOTO CREDIT: Medical-on-Line/Alamy Also known as diabetic retinopathy , this is a chronic condition caused by diabetes. Around 7.7 million Americans have diabetic retinopathy, according to the National Eye Institute . Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive area at the back of the eyes. At first the condition will cause minor vision problems, such as difficulty seeing at a distance. But as diabetes progresses, so too will vision loss, and it may eventually lead to blindness. Laser treatments can be used to treat diabetic retinopathy. Some patients may have vitrectomy surgery, in which the gel-like matter is removed from the middle of the eye. The procedure is followed by laser surgery to remove the blood and scar tissue that forms in the eye. Some doctors may give a patient medication injections, such as ranibizumab , to reduce inflammation or stop the growth of blood vessels. All these treatments may slow vision loss, but they can't cure diabetic retinopathy or fully restore vision.  4 Presbyopia: Farsightedness   PHOTO CREDIT: nei.nih.gov Starting around age 40, eyes begin to lose their focus, a condition that's known as presbyopia . The ""aging eye"" is a natural part of getting old and affects nearly everyone. But presbyopia can make daily activities â€” such as reading and working at the computer â€” especially challenging. Fortunately, for many individuals, eyeglasses or contact lenses usually do the trick. They can correct or improve vision, and a doctor can increase the strength of your prescription as needed over time.  5 Glaucoma: Damage to the Optic Nerve   PHOTO CREDIT: BSIP SA/Alamy Glaucoma refers to a collection of eye conditions that can eventually damage the optic nerve. Often, but not always, a result of increased pressure in the eye, known as intraocular pressure, glaucoma can lead to loss of peripheral vision and, over time, cause total blindness if left untreated. It's estimated that 2.7 million Americans have glaucoma and 4.3 million will have it by 2030, according to the National Eye Institute . The optic nerve damage of glaucoma, known as the ""silent thief of sight,"" can be prevented by lowering intraocular pressure with topical eye drops or surgery.  6 Dry Eyes Syndrome   PHOTO CREDIT: Getty Images For vision to remain clear, the eyes must be sufficiently lubricated. Many seniors experience dry eyes from low tear production. Though this condition is largely benign, it can greatly impact vision, and cause a person to experience eye discomfort, including stinging and burning. There isn't a cure for dry eyes, but saline lubricating drops or artificial tears can help to relieve some of the discomfort and keep vision clearer. There are also prescription drugs to help manage the condition.",ranibizumab,2,,,

"There's an old saying in medicine, ""When you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras."" The logic behind the adage is that the common answer is usually the correct one. This is all well and good for the horses, but us zebras can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. I have ROS1 lung cancer, meaning that my cancer is driven by a mutation in the ROS1 gene. There is an explosion of research currently underway, examining the genetic causes of cancer. ROS1 is rare, accounting for only about 1 to 2 percent of all lung cancers. In fact, it wasnâ€™t until March of 2016 that a drug was FDA approved specifically for ROS1 -positive lung cancer. Xalkori (crizotinib) is the drug that has been saving my life for over two years. I went to a conference two years ago that focused on acquired resistance to targeted medicines. The afternoon sessions broke out by mutation type: EGFR, ALK and ROS1 . Us zebras were tickled pink to see eight people with ROS1 , since none of us had ever met another one before. ""We better take a picture, I don't think there have ever been this many ROS1 -ers in the same room!"" Since then, I have been on a quest to track down others with this rare mutation. Along the way, I met up with several others who were equally driven to form a connection and gather us zebras into a dazzle (really â€“ that's the term for a group of zebras). It started as an informal series of text messages where we kept tacking on more people. At some point, one of us said it might be less unwieldy if we just formed a Facebook group. And so we did. This group has become a place for us to share our treatment journeys, discuss clinical trials, exchange advice on symptom management and pool our knowledge. As the months went on, and we told our doctors about the group, we realized what a wealth of information we had amassed. It was then that the wheels started turning. There is a ton of exciting research happening in cancer these days, but being such a small group had us concerned that we would get overlooked. We are a rare breed, so zebras have to stick together. Someone in the group suggested approaching the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation asking if they would create a study just for us. It was a long shot, but we are a group of people with advanced cancer, so what did we have to lose by asking? When you are in a situation like this, facing an absolutely terrifying and dire diagnosis and prognosis, it is very nice when someone is willing to listen to your concerns. It is even more heartening when they offer to help you. It is a lovely surprise when they take steps to support you. But it is exceedingly rare and wonderful when they actually put muscle and money behind a plan to help you reach your goals. That is exactly what Bonnie J. Addario and her foundation did. Over the past few months, a subset of our ROS1 group (which now numbers over 100 people from around the globe) have been participating in conference calls with the foundation to create connections with researchers, health care providers and other stakeholders to investigate this mutation and ultimately create a ROS1 repository that can serve to further research and treatments for our mutation. You can read more about this incredible, patient-driven initiative on the Lung Cancer Foundation website: http://www.lungcancerfoundation.org/patients/ros1/ If you or someone you know has a ROS1 cancer, please follow this link the answer an online survey about your disease. This is an easy step to further the understanding of ROS1 cancer. http://www.lungcancerfoundation.org/patients/ros1/survey/ I am beyond excited to be part of this initiative, and am empowered to be part of a group of patients who are speaking up and being heard. Having metastatic lung cancer really sucks, but I have met some of the most amazing people because of it. And really, who can overlook a dazzle of zebras?

"Exciting News! Ocrelizumab offers Expanded Access Program in over 50 locations for participants with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis! Ocrelizumab, which has been granted Priority Review Designation, announces expanded Access Program for Ocrelizumab in Participants With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis The primary objective of this expanded access program (EAP) is to provide ocrelizumab as treatment for eligible participants with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) before it is commercially available in the United States (U.S.) for the indication of PPMS. An EAP enables participants to receive an investigational medication that has not yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This program is a nontraditional study that has no placebo group, so all those enrolled are given the active medication. It follows a strict protocol that has been developed through consultation with the FDA. Through Ocrelizumabâ€™s EAP, enrolled participants will receive the study medication, given every six months via two infusions, which are separated by two weeks.

"As usual, I beg to differ â€“ obs Dr Gi has made some sweeping statements; unsubstantiated and unfair. â€œRich people will still be able to get it ?!â€.. is misleadin and suggestive it works; which it doesnâ€™t, or am I missing a trick? He isnâ€™t the Oracle and NICE are trying to protect the NHS from being raped, as well as us from dying. This drug has killed seven people and withdrawn from treatment of rheumatoid arthritis! it hasnâ€™t been trialled properly and thoroughly on SP patients. How could it have been?! The good research @seanchai provides evidenceâ€¦. â€œBut a patient died on the ocrelizumab arm from an unexpected â€œsystemic inflammatory syndromeâ€. That could be chance and still hope larger studies to be assuredâ€¦ butâ€¦. Several rheumatoid arthritis trials with ocrelizumab have been terminated because â€œthe overall benefit to risk profile of ocrelizumab was not favorableâ€ what it really means that 7 patients died unexpectedly in the high ocrelizumab dose arms of the trials.â€ And as for Cladribine: â€œPhase III trial testing cladribine in multiple sclerosis were published in the New England Journal of Medicine the same day that fingolimod results were reported. Despite a similar effectiveness compared to fingolimod, the increased frequency of neoplasms, severe infections and deaths compared to placebo, led to negative reports of FDA and EMEA and was not approved. Profile: Cladribine is a chemotherapeutic drug that is used in a rare leukemia. Itâ€™s a purine analog, so it interferes in DNA synthesis. Usually cells can metabolize it easily, but not blood cells, so it acts as a cytotoxic drug in those cells.â€ Sorry, but Iâ€™d be more upset if NICE had agreed to ocrelizumab We need to fight for an actual cure â€“ like most â€œinsurance policiesâ€ nowadays; they ainâ€™t worth the paper they are written on â€¦",fingolimod,2,,,

"In the U.S. Amjevita Pharmacologic Class: Adalimumab  Uses For Amjevita Adalimumab-atto injection is used to treat the symptoms and prevent the progression of moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is used in children 4 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This medicine is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Psoriatic arthritis usually occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Adalimumab-atto may be used alone or in combination with medicines (eg, methotrexate). Adalimumab-atto injection is also used to treat the symptoms of active Crohnâ€™s disease in patients who have not been helped by other medicines (eg, infliximab). It is also used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in patients who have been treated with other medicines (eg, azathioprine, corticosteroids, or 6-mercaptopurine) that did not work well. This medicine may also be used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, which is a skin disease with red patches and white scales that donâ€™t go away. This medicine is available only with your doctorâ€™s prescription.  Before Using Amjevita In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:  Allergies Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.  Pediatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-atto injection for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 4 to 17 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and safety and efficacy have not been established for other uses in children.  Geriatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-atto injection in the elderly. However, this medicine may cause serious infections and cancer more often in the elderly, which may require caution in patients receiving adalimumab-atto injection.  Breast Feeding There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

Proper Use of Amjevita This medicine is given as a shot under your skin. Adalimumab-atto may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using this medicine at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine. This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient Instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. This medicine is available in 2 forms. You may use a prefilled SureClickÂ® autoinjector or a prefilled syringe. To use the autoinjector or syringe: First, gather the items you will need on a clean, flat surface using a cloth or towel in a well-lighted area. Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using this medicine. Remove the carton with the syringe or pen from the refrigerator and place it on the cloth. Allow 15 to 30 minutes for the syringe or autoinjector to warm up to room temperature. Do not warm this medicine in any other way. Do not remove the needle cover on the prefilled syringe or autoinjector while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature. Remove these immediately before use. Check the liquid in the syringe or autoinjector using the viewing window. It should be clear and colorless. If it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles floating in it, do not use the syringe or autoinjector. Check that the amount of liquid in the autoinjector is the same or close to the fill line seen on the window. The fill line shows a full dose of the medicine. If the autoinjector does not have the full amount of liquid, do not use it. Call your pharmacist. If the liquid is clear, place it on a clean, flat surface. Do not shake the medicine. Check the expiration date on the prefilled syringe or autoinjector, and make sure the date has not passed. Do not use the medicine if the date has passed. Choose an injection site on your body (eg, thigh, abdomen or stomach area). Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe and let it dry. Remove the cap or needle cover when you are ready to inject. Inject the full amount of medicine within a few minutes after the cap or cover has been removed. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, or hard. If you have psoriasis, do not inject into a raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patch or into skin lesions. You might have a small amount of blood or liquid at the injection site. Press and hold a dry, clean cotton ball on the injection site for 10 seconds, but do not rub it. Throw away used syringes or autoinjector in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through (puncture-resistant). Keep this container away from children and pets.  Dosing The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For injection dosage forms (autoinjector or prefilled syringe):  For Crohnâ€™s disease: Adultsâ€”At first (week 0), 160 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin in divided doses. This may be given as four shots in 1 day or as two shots per day for 2 days. Then 2 weeks later, a dose of 80 mg is given. A maintenance dose of 40 mg is given at week 4 and every other week thereafter. Childrenâ€”Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.  For juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Children 4 to 17 years of age weighing 30 kilograms (kg) or moreâ€”40 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin every other week. Children 4 to 17 years of age weighing between 15 to less than 30 kgâ€”20 mg injected under the skin every other week. Children younger than 4 years of ageâ€”Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.  For plaque psoriasis: Adultsâ€”At first, 80 milligrams (mg) injected under the skin, then 40 mg 1 week after the initial dose and every other week thereafter. Childrenâ€”Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.

A maintenance dose of 40 mg is given at week 4 and every other week thereafter. Childrenâ€”Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.  Missed Dose If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.  Storage Keep out of the reach of children. Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use. Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze. Protect the medicine from direct light. Keep your medicine and supplies in the original packages until you are ready to use them. Also, when traveling, store the medicine in a cool carrier with an ice pack or store at room temperature for up to 14 days.  Precautions While Using Amjevita If you will be using this medicine for a long time, it is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child at regular visits . This will allow your doctor to see if this medicine is working properly and to decide whether you should continue to use it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test. Adalimumab-atto can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which may increase the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding: If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin. Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done. Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime. Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters. Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur. Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. Using abatacept (OrenciaÂ®) or anakinra (KineretÂ®) together with this medicine may increase your risk of having serious side effects. This medicine may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after this medicine is used. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this type of medicine have developed certain types of cancer (eg, leukemia). Some patients also developed a type of cancer called lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you or your child have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus. Adalimumab-atto may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, throat, legs, or feet, troubled breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: shortness of breath, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, or sudden weight gain. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF). Some people who have used this medicine developed lupus-like symptoms during treatment and got better after the medicine was stopped. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pains, shortness of breath, joint pain, or a rash on your cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun. Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab-atto. Your childâ€™s vaccines need to be current before he or she begins using adalimumab-atto. Be sure to ask your childâ€™s doctor if you have any questions about this. The needle cover of the autoinjector or prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you start using this medicine.  Amjevita Side Effects Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.

"Tuesday, March 14, 2017 09:54PM SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- On a good day, watching Sarah Warto climb the stairs you might not guess that she suffers from multiple sclerosis. But shortly after the birth of her daughter, 2.5 years ago symptoms kicked in. ""It effected my ability to walk. That was probably the biggest issue for me because as the mother of a newborn child all I wanted to do was get up and run around after her,"" Warto said. Now, she's waiting on the potential approval of a new drug that could change the course of her disease, and possibly her life. Stephen Hauser, M.D. of UCSF helped oversee testing of the drug. It was developed by Bay Area-based Genentech, and it's clinical name is Ocrelizumab. Hauser says it was able to disrupt symptoms in the less severe form of multiple sclerosis, called relapsing. ""Ocrelizumab has been able to nearly completely stop disease activity in people with relapsing and remitting forms of Multiple Sclerosis,"" Hauser said. He says it was even able to reduce symptoms from the much more damaging form of the disease called progressive, which can ultimately rob patients of the ability to move on their own. ""So for people with relapsing MS this is spectacular news. And for people with progressive MS the door is finally open,"" Hauser said.",ocrelizumab,0,,,

"Hi Daxys, Iâ€™d be circumspect about interpreting clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors since your Mum has a uncommon variant and that variant is known to respond significantly better to second generation TKI therapies like Afatinib than to first or third generation, at least as first line treatment.  This is different than Exon 19 and 21 mutations that respond best to Osimertinib (third generation) as first line. So I would not read too much into the studies that do not focus on your Mumâ€™s initial mutation. I would also wonder if the brain met (if that is what it is) only arose when your Mum was taken of off Afatinib. Without knowing the mutations she presently has it is hard to make any inferences. My inclination would be to try a rechallenge with Afatinib and see if that changes the rate of growth. If it slows things down at all. Afatinib also penetrates the blood brain barrier. It is noteworthy that your Mumâ€™s rate of progression changed once she was taken off of Afatinib. Barring using Afatinib either alone or in combination (as Jim suggested in his post) since you already have access to Osimertinib that might be the best course at this point that is available to you.   10/2015 Chest xray found a nodule as part of a physical (no symptoms). 01/2016 Upper left lobe lingula preserving lobectomy stage 2b for 1.9 cm invasive adenocarcinoma with additional 2 mm AIS nodule found in pathology. 03-05/2016 Sixteen weeks of adjuvant cisplatin/vinorelbine. 07/2016  Durvalumab adjuvant clinical trial discontinued after 1st dose knocked out thyroid. 12/2016 Revised to stage 1b (due to VPI) after new guidelines for multifocal lepidic lung cancer. 07/2019 Next scan.",osimertinib,2,,,

"from WHTC Radio Rocheâ€™s immunotherapy Tecentriq, given with its older drug Avastin and chemotherapy, improved survival of advanced lung cancer patients by about 30 percent over the combination without Tecentriq, according to interim results of a late stage trial released on Wednesday. But there was no survival benefit for Tecentriq plus chemotherapy over an Avastin and chemotherapy combination in the brief summary of data that became available on Wednesday. The Phase III study involved 800 people with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer had spread but who had not yet received chemotherapy. More detailed data from the trial will be presented next month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Roche is conducting several Tecentriq lung cancer trials and expects to announce this summer results from a trial of the drug in combination with Alimta and carboplatin. The Tecentriq/Avastin/chemo combination also showed a survival advantage for patients with EGFR and ALK mutations who were first treated with drugs targeting those genetic markers but who had not yet received chemotherapy, the company said. It also showed that patients whose cancer had spread to the liver lived for a median of 13.2 months after receiving the four-drug combination, compared with 9.1 months for those given only Avastin and chemotherapy. An estimated 234,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, with NSCLC accounting for about 85 percent of cases, according to the American Cancer Society.",avastin,2,,,
"RedHill Biopharma Ltd. announced positive top-line safety and efficacy results from the first Phase III study with RHB 104 for Crohnâ€™s disease (the MAP US study). The study successfully met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. Top-line results in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population demonstrated superiority of RHB 104 over placebo in achieving remission at week 26, defined as Crohnâ€™s Disease Active Index (CDAI) value of less than 150, the primary endpoint of the study. The proportion of patients meeting the primary endpoint was significantly greater in the RHB-104 group compared to placebo (37% vs. 23%, p= 0.013). The study also successfully met key secondary endpoints, demonstrating consistent benefit to Crohnâ€™s disease patients treated with RHB 104. Patients treated with RHB 104 also achieved a statistically significant greater response at week 26 (defined as a decrease of more than 100 in CDAI from baseline) compared to placebo (44% vs. 31%, p= 0.028). Patients treated with RHB 104 also experienced a statistically significant benefit in achieving early remission defined as remission at week 16 (42% vs. 29%, p= 0.019). Patients receiving RHB 104 also experienced a statistically significant benefit in durable remission over weeks 16-52, defined as continuous remission throughout the period, (18% vs. 9%, p= 0.038), demonstrating an improvement of 100% over placebo. At 52 weeks of treatment, remission in the RHB 104 arm continued to be favorable to placebo (27% vs. 20%, p= 0.155). An analysis of maintenance of remission at week 52 in subjects noted to be in remission at week 16 also demonstrated statistically significant benefit with RHB 104 over placebo (25% vs. 12%, p= 0.007). RHB 104 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated. Top-line results demonstrated that the active and placebo treatment groups experienced similarly low rates of serious adverse events and treatment emergent adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation, indicating a positive safety profile for RHB 104. The company will continue to assess additional exploratory endpoints as data becomes available, including mucosal healing, MAP status, quality of life assessment, sub-population analyses and pharmacokinetics.

"SUMMARY A study based at Johns Hopkins University is comparing two treatment strategies in 900 people newly diagnosed, or with onset/diagnosis in the past who have received minimal or no treatment, with the relapsing-remitting form of MS. The study is recruiting at approximately 45 centers nationwide. One option is an escalation approach, in which patients start taking a less-powerful therapy with the option of switching to a more potent therapy if disease activity continues. The other approach involves starting with a stronger therapy that is potentially more effective, but also carries the potential for greater risk for significant adverse effects. The â€œTRaditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for Multiple Sclerosisâ€ (TREAT-MS) Trial is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). DETAILS Rationale : There is an unmet need to identify if specific treatment strategies during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS can prevent, delay, or reduce longer-term disability. Particularly, it is unclear whether people who experience disease activity while on a traditional, first-line disease-modifying therapy (these include injectable or oral medications for the TREAT-MS trial) should switch to a different first-line therapy or if they should escalate immediately to a higher-efficacy therapy (therapies with greater effectiveness but possibly more side effects, delivered via infusion). The TREAT-MS Trial is one of two studies funded by PCORI that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS). Eligibility and Details : Investigators are seeking participants diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years. Participants are not eligible if they have had more than 6 months of exposure to one or more MS disease-modifying therapies or had any prior treatment with rituximab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, cladribine, or an experimental aggressive therapy. Further enrollment criteria are available from the contact below. Eligible participants will be divided into two groups based on whether they show characteristics that may make them at higher risk for long-term disability. Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to either a traditional or early aggressive therapy. Participants and their neurology specialist will choose the therapy within the category that is most appropriate for them. Those deemed at low risk for disability who are initially randomly assigned to a traditional therapy and who then experience ongoing disease activity and are interested in switching therapies will be randomly assigned to a different traditional therapy or early aggressive therapy. Study participation will range from 42 â€“ 54 months, depending on enrollment date. Study related activities will occur around a participantâ€™s standard visits to their local health care providers. The primary outcome being measured is the time to sustained disability progression, as determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-plus, a combined outcome that includes change in either the EDSS or timed 25-foot walk (testing mobility and leg function) or nine-hole peg test (measuring upper extremity function). Investigators will also monitor symptoms such as fatigue, mobility, and cognition, and will track brain MRI scans. Also, patient reported outcomes â€“ in which participants report their own perceptions about their condition -- will be obtained to gain a better understanding of the full impact of treatment.

"Only 3 more days until I get and find out my latest PET scan. I'm somewhat nervous because my tarceva dosage was lowered. I have very few people where I live now that I can truly sit down and talk too about everything. I'm so thankful for the people I do have and for God. I try to give my worry to Him. It's hard to be brave in front of Karley sometimes. These scans are so irritating. I used to not worry, but I'm 2 years in and now 3 days until, and I'm worried about something beyond my control. Anyways. Enough about worry. Chris Draft was fabulous this past Sunday and took Karley, Stephen, and I to the Jaguars game. It was so much fun. Cold and rainy and we lost, but we had a blast. I thank God for these 3 people that went with me. They are amazing. If you want to donate to a good lung cancer cause, donate to www.teamdraft.org Thank you for all of your continuous prayers and please pray for good scans this Friday. I feel like I really need your prayers right now. God bless you all!             1 Corinthians 12:4-8 â€œ Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude.

"I've been following this thread since the beginning. I am a firm believer in ginger root tea for the relief of arthritis pain in my shoulders. I can easily see that getting the juice out of the fiber, with no heat used, could be much better. I've used many herbal remedies over time; some work, some don't. Ginger and cinnamon are two that have worked for me and ginger works great. I had to give up cinnamon due to my blood getting too thin and bruising too easily. BUT ginger...is some wonderful stuff. I never noticed much change in my UC due to it, but find it interesting to follow. It's a bit amazing that, after talking with a REAL herbalist...not another moron like myself...that every weed in most everyone's lawns...have a medicinal purpose.

"My mother was diagnosed with NSCLC in 2014 and was on Chemo for a year until it started to not work. She is stage IV because of a pleural effusion in addition to a small nodule in her right lung. Chemo did result in stabilizing the tumor and resolving a nearby early stage lymph node metastasis. She is otherwise very healthy. keeping her weight, and exercising. She did well on chemo, other than high blood pressure, but the chemo started to not work. So, for almost a year she is on Opdivo. the first 6 months there was no signs for concern. Now, after nearly a year, she had a PET scan and she is going in for a lung biopsy and there is concerns about some area in the pancreas and under her arm pit. We are terrified, since we believed that the immunotherapy was going to be the solution until the next great breakthroughâ€¦..So, my question that I cannot seem to find anywhere, is can people in this situation go back onto a chemo drug treatment after immunotherapyâ€¦.and is this type of possible set back a typical occurrence. The oncologist said early on that immunotherapy sometimes looks worst before it gets better. Any thoughts you can share with me? I find it difficult to find anything other than positive information on Immunotherapyâ€¦.For those that find this drug does not work due to their individual histology, what are the options? Any help you can offer me and me family would be grateful to hear. Please pray for her, she is everything to us. God bless and Thank you",opdivo,2,,,

"Merck spent some time to turn an off-patent drug (s.c./i.v.) into an on-patent (oral) preparation and then went for the lower hanging fruit first, which is early relapsing disease where plenty of MRI activity and relapses facilitate positive outcome detection. At the time CLARITY and ORACLE MS were undertaken, this was entirely understandable. Who knows, had the EMA looked a little harder at the suspected cancer risk, and not misinterpreted lymphopenia as an adverse effect (it is ""the effect""), Movectro may have obtained a license in 2011, patent life would have been longer, and trials in progressive MS an obvious follow-on project. Now it's a different story and I would be surprised if the company spends a few hundred million to develop Mavenclad for progressive disease, but may be there is a change of heart; we're working on it. We have a trial design for CHARIOT MS, which I'll post next week once our first collaborator meeting has taken place, however not (yet) the funding. We can do the trial for less than Â£5 million. Let me know if you know somebody able and willing to chip in big. Our current offer for people with progressive MS is entirely compassionate, with a plausible rationale, however limited data, and we're totally transparent about that. People have to sign consent that they have understood this. Do we have any luck? Well, you know that Ocrelizumab required 3 years and many hundred patients to show an effect, so fat chance to detect a difference with no control arm atm. What I can say is that the treatment is exceptionally well tolerated. The Biotin trial allows inclusion of people on DMT, so yes we are prepared to include people who are on cladribine. We don't know whether memory cells in the brain are affected. Contrary to drugs that don't penetrate into the CNS cladribine certainly has the potential. At this time, however, we don't even know to what degree memory B cells in the peripheral are depleted; first anecdotal evidence suggests it works well that way, but data is preliminary. We encourage people with progressive MS to have 2 LP's over the course of 2 years in order to obtain their neurofilament levels, however this is not mandatory.",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"Juhi Kunde, LUNGevity Science Writer Last weekend, close to 40,000 oncology professionals, including superstar lung cancer researchers (many of whom are members of LUNGevityâ€™s Scientific Advisory Board), gathered in Chicago to attend the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO. This year, the conference was dominated by studies focused on immunotherapy, disease treatments that leverage the bodyâ€™s natural immune response. The field of immunotherapy is bursting with options. The breakthroughs from this new approach to disease management flow into research for the treatment of lung cancer. Below I have summarized highlights from the 2018 ASCO conference.  Immunotherapy Immunotherapy has been found to be effective in tumor cells expressing high levels of the protein PD-L1. However, PD-L1 is not always a reliable biomarker because it tends to fluctuate over time, and some areas of the tumor may express more PD-L1 than other areas. Also, tumors that do not make PD-L1 protein can still respond to immunotherapy. With this in mind, researchers have been working to optimize the biomarkers used to predict which patients will benefit from immunotherapy. They found that measuring the tumor mutational burden (TMB), the number of mutations in the tumor DNA, may be a promising approach to predicting patientsâ€™ responses to immunotherapy. Sometimes TMB may be used in conjunction with PD-L1 levels to provide guidance for cancer treatment. One important phase 3 clinical trial looked at bevacizumab (an anti-cancer drug known to reduce the tumorâ€™s ability to promote blood vessel growth required to feed the cancer) in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The initial results showed that adding atezolizumab, an immunotherapy drug, to bevacizumab and carboplatin/paclitaxel (two chemotherapy drugs often used as doublet treatment) decreased cancer progression and increased overall survival, compared with the same regimen without the immunotherapy. While more research is needed, this study also raises hope for patients with EGFR-positive and ALK-positive NSCLC. The trial results note that patients who have shown progression on an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or an ALK TKI responded well to the combination approach of bevacizumab with doublet chemotherapy and atezolizumab. Another key phase 3 clinical trial studied the effect of adding an immunotherapy agent to the current recommendation for first-line treatment of advanced squamous NSCLC. Researchers found that when the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab was added to doublet chemotherapy, the patients saw a significant increase in overall survival. This study is likely to result in a change in the current guidelines for first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. Many different clinical studies are underway to determine the optimal combination of lung cancer treatments (including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation). Also, research is being conducted to identify the optimized sequence of treatments to enhance patientsâ€™ survival rates and quality of life.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with driver mutations Lots of progress is also happening for NSCLC with driver mutations! In a phase 1 clinical trial, patients with advanced NSCLC who were positive for RET-fusions had very promising results with the drug LOXO-292, which selectively targets RET-fusion proteins. Additional studies are planned to further develop this treatment option.  Small Cell Lung Cancer Excitement around Rova-T continues. LUNGevityâ€™s Scientific Advisory Board member David Carbone, MD, PhD, at Ohio State University, presented phase 2 clinical trial results showing that the protein DLL-3, which is found at high levels only in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tissue and not in healthy tissue, could be the first targeted therapy for advanced SCLC. The results showed that Rova-T, which binds to DLL-3, improved overall survival for SCLC patients whose cancer had returned after chemotherapy. In addition, scientists are exploring the potential of immunotherapy in SCLC. Data from a phase 2 clinical trial suggests that pembrolizumab may be effective in SCLC patients who have progressed on chemotherapy and whose tumors are positive for the PD-L1 protein.  Early Detection And finally, progress with liquid biopsies continues in the field of early detection. When someone develops cancer, their blood often contains pieces of the mutated DNA that escape from dying tumor cells. Tumor DNA found in the blood is often called circulating DNA (ctDNA) or plasma cell-free DNA (plasma cfDNA). Recently, liquid biopsy tests have become available to analyze ctDNA and determine whether a patient has cancer and, if so, what type of cancer. The results of a study presented at ASCO suggest the technique may also be used for detecting early-stage lung cancer. The researchers are developing the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (CCGA) aimed at understanding how liquid biopsies can be used for early detection and complement CT screening. More research is underway in the hopes of developing this technique into a useful, lifesaving tool for the early detection of lung cancer. In his presidential address, ASCO President Dr. Bruce Johnson mentioned that â€œwe are close to being able to treat half of our patients with NSCLC with targeted therapy or immunotherapy as their initial treatment.â€ We are encouraged by the progress we saw at ASCO this year, and we are confident that the next year will bring even more.

"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed 3 years ago with MS. I first went on Gilenya, which made me so foggy I couldnâ€™t drive or work. Next I tried Copaxone. Got used to giving myself shots but after an MRI my neurologist said she thought it wasnâ€™t helping. So now Iâ€™m in my 3rd month of Tecfidera and managing this med well. December I get another MRI. I have experienced lots of bladder problem and have learned to manage these well, although itâ€™s annoying. I wanted to know if anyone has experienced problems with their bowels? Yuck. I know itâ€™s not a pretty subject. Sometimes I feel like I donâ€™t have the muscle power to empty my bowels all the way. Itâ€™s not constipation.

"of natalizumab exposure."" ""Since NHS England gave us permission to switch high-risk natalizumab patients to fingolimod, we are continuing to de-risk our natalizumab-treated population. We are hoping by doing this to prevent anyone at our centre from getting PML. Despite this some MSers are not prepared to stop natalizumab, simply because they are doing so well on the drug."" ""The following is the most important headline data slide for MSers regarding risks based on the three identified PML risk factors:  JCV serostatus Duration of treatment Previous exposure to immunosuppression  In addition to this is appears that titres or levels of anti-JCV antibodies also play a role in risk (see below) and this needs to be incorporated into future risk models."" ""We have developed a simple infographic to help you integrate all this information. You can download and print this infographic for your own information."" Plavina et al. Use of JC virus antibody index to stratify risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in natalizumab-treated patients with multiple sclerosis. ENS 2013 Multiple Sclerosis I: Therapeutics Objectives : In MSers treated with natalizumab, the presence of anti-JCV antibodies (JCV Ab+), prior use of immunosuppressants (IS), and increased duration of natalizumab treatment, especially greater than 2 years, are known risk factors for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). With polyomaviruses, higher levels of antibodies have been correlated with increased viral burden and increased disease risk. It is not known whether JCV Ab levels correlate with PML risk in natalizumab-treated MSers. The objective of this analysis is to examine the association between JCV Ab index (JCV antibody level as measured using the STRATIFY JCV DX Select assay) and PML risk in natalizumab-treated MSers. Methods : Analyses involved JCV Ab index data from JCV Ab+ MSers enrolled in clinical studies or clinical practice. A cross-sectional analysis of JCV Ab index data from MSers without PML was first performed to assess potential relationships between JCV Ab index and known risk factors (natalizumab treatment duration <=24 vs >24 monthly infusions and prior IS use). P values were calculated using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The association between JCV Ab index and PML was then assessed using all available longitudinal data. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from generalised estimating equations with a logit link. The predicted probabilities were then used to update the current PML risk estimates for JCV Ab+ MSers with high/low Ab index by applying Bayes theorem. Results : JCV Ab index data were available from 71 natalizumab-treated PML MSers at least 6 months prior to PML diagnosis and from 2522 non-PML JCV Ab+ MSers. JCV Ab index was not found to be associated with number of natalizumab infusions (P=0.39) nor prior IS use (P=0.43), but was significantly associated with PML risk (P<0.001). Estimated ORs were at least 4 for high versus low JCV Ab index in JCV Ab+ MSers. Updated PML risk estimates and longitudinal stability of JCV Ab index will be presented. Conclusion : Risk of PML in JCV Ab negative natalizumab-treated MSers is very low (0.07 per 1000). In JCV Ab+ MSers who have low JCV Ab index, the risk of PML is several-fold lower than the risk currently attributed to all JCV Ab+ MSers. Utilisation of JCV Ab index allows for further clinically meaningful stratification of PML risk in JCV Ab+ natalizumab-treated MSers.      ""The figures in the bottom table are derived from Table 2 above and present the data in a different way, rather as per thousand an absolute risk. You have to realise that these figures are derived from relatively small numbers, i.e. 51 cases of PML. But the data is what it is and will not be confirmed by anyone else. I assume as more cases emerge the data set will be updated. The implications of this data is that many MSers who are doing well on natalizumab and have low titres, or a low index, may choose to stay on natalizumab rather than switch. In those MSers who are high risk and have elected to stay on natalizumab we have started doing 3 monthly MRI monitoring for early signs of PML. The idea behind the latter strategy is to detect PML very early and wash-out natalizumab. It is clear that if PML is picked up in the asymptomatic phase and managed quickly MSers do much better; this is highlighted in slides 35 and 36 above."" CoI : multiple",fingolimod,0,,,

""Merck is committed to advancing patient care and offering therapeutic options that help address unmet medical needs for people with MS, with a focus on efficacy, dosing, durability and safety,"" said  Luciano Rossetti , Global Head of Research & Development for Merck's biopharma business. ""We look forward to sharing additional data on Rebif Â® and Cladribine Tablets with the scientific community at this year's ECTRIMS Congress."" Oral presentations include a comparison of the CLARITY and the CLARITY EXTENSION studies, which sought to examine the duration of clinical outcome response to Cladribine Tablets, and results of the SOLAR study, which examined the effects of adding high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to Rebif Â® therapy for patients with RRMS. Poster presentations will report on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes in patients treated with Cladribine Tablets or Rebif Â® and patient-reported outcomes in patients being treated with Rebif Â® . Several health economics outcomes research presentations will highlight key issues facing people with MS, including pregnancy outcomes. In addition to data presentations, a Merck-sponsored satellite symposium, ""Reimagining the MS Treatment Journey,"" will take place  Wednesday, September 14 ,  18:45-19:45 BST in Hall A at the ExCel. The panel session will feature distinguished experts in MS who will debate whether unmet needs in MS care remain, consider what an ideal MS therapy might look like, and review current and potential future therapies. On  Thursday, September 15 , Merck will hold its fourth annual Grant for Multiple Sclerosis Innovations (GMSI) Awards symposium. Up to â‚¬1 million will be awarded to one or more researchers to support work that aims to improve the understanding of MS for the ultimate benefit of patients.

About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in  the United States ,  Canada and  Europe .  About Rebif Â® Rebif Â® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif Â® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ÃŸ is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif Â® , which was approved in  Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif Â® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif Â® can be administrated with the RebiSmart Â® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose Â® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlideâ„¢. Rebif Â® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II Â® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes.

"Safe foods . A uniquely personal definition, an honestly life-changing concept for those in need.  I quickly learned my safe foods after diagnosis Nine years ago, shortly after I began experiencing symptoms of IBD, I quickly learned that there were certain foods that I could tolerate more often than not. Regardless of their nutritional value, these food items became the things I relied so heavily on. While some have had luck with the faithful BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce and toast) or giving up certain categories like dairy, or gluten, or sugar, I have mostly lived in the realm of carb safety â€“ crackers, rice, pasta, bread, rolls.  These safe foods have been essential at certain times Safe foods were especially paramount to me when I needed to function as a human being. Whether it was to go to work, to run to the grocery store, or to think straightly. There seemed to generally be a better chance of my retaining the energy from the food, and less of a chance of my rushing to the bathroom after eating the food than nearly anything else I tried. During my Crohnâ€™s disease flares over the years, I always returned to some version of carb life when my stomach was in ruins and I wasnâ€™t keeping much else inside. I often felt like eating was this â€˜terrible, horrible, no good, very badâ€™ thing I was forced to do, and so many times I wished to just skip food altogether . My safe foods very rarely have let me down over the years, and for that, I have an endless amount of gratitude.  I finally was able to add more food variety into my life I switched to Remicade infusions in March 2017. By about August, although we were still playing with the dose and frequency of infusions , I was having more good days than bad ones for the first time in years. My IBD became more stable than anytime previously, and I found that I had all this new flexibility in what I was able to eat. I entered a chapter of my life in which I sometimes even enjoyed the food. Something so so different than the many years before. I was able to fill my plate, and my diet, with things that sounded good to me, things I was interested in trying, things that had actual nutritional value. I began to meal plan â€“ a luxury I had never had before, and I really enjoyed it. I knew that it might not last, so I focused on the benefits while they existed.  Back to the safe foods In September, my husband and I went through our second round of In-Vitro Fertilization , which successfully resulted in my current pregnancy with our first child. During my first trimester, I have experienced morning sickness in the form of daily nausea with periodic vomiting, and my bowels have gone through some confusion. My â€œregularâ€ bowel movements transitioned back to diarrhea a few times a day due to the hormones of pregnancy , which meant that everything I had gotten used to in the year before changed really quickly! I realized fairly quickly when I was feeling queasy or like my stomach was upset that I was reaching for the things Iâ€™ve always known as safe foods â€“ carbs. At first, I felt concerned. Would my safety food default diet mean that my baby wasnâ€™t getting enough nutrients? Both my GI and OB doctors re-assured me that for a mom in the first trimester , the goal is to eat whatever you can, whenever you can. The baby will take what the baby needs, unabashedly so, and a lot of that will come from the prenatal vitamins youâ€™re taking. The doctors said the most important thing I needed to focus on was staying hydrated . Luckily, life with IBD has made me a pro at that! I have found it fascinating that this safety diet, the one I have defaulted to so often in the last nine years, has now served me beyond IBD flares . I didnâ€™t expect to utilize this strategy during pregnancy, or in other times in my life, but here I am grateful to have options, and understanding of the things that generally keep my guts calm. With IBD, chronic illness, surgery , or during other times in your life, how have your safe foods offered you security + relief?",remicade,0,,,

Oral medication; 0.5 mg capsule taken once daily Approved for relapsing forms of MS Previous: Tysabri | Next: Laquinimod Gilenya is the first in a class of immuno-modulatory drugs called â€œS1P-receptor modulators.â€ It is similar in structure to a naturally occurring component of cell-surface receptors on white blood cells. (White blood cells are produced by the immune system to fight infection and disease.) Gilenya blocks potentially damaging T cells from leaving lymph nodes, lowering their number in the blood and tissues. It may reduce damage to the CNS and enhance the repair of damaged nerves within the brain and spinal cord. Although Gilenya was approved for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in 2010, clinical trials have continued to evaluate its role in MS. The 36-month INFORMS trial evaluated the effect of Gilenya relative to placebo on delaying the time to sustained disability progression in patients with PPMS. As there is presently no FDA-approved medicine for PPMS , this was an important study for the field. The enrollment of 969 PPMS patients into the INFORMS trial was completed in 2011, and the trialâ€™s data analysis was completed in 2014. Novartis announced in December 2014 that unfortunately, the primary outcome of the study was not met. Gilenya did not show a significant difference from placebo on a combination of disability measures. A novel, primary-composite disability endpoint was used in the trial, based on the increase in disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 25-Foot Timed-Walk Test (T25FW), and the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). Other key endpoints were the formation of new lesions and percentage of brain-volume change (PBVC), or brain atrophy (the shrinking or reduction of brain volume). Detailed results of the trial were presented in spring 2015. Gilenya did not prevent the accumulation of disability in patients with PPMS any greater than placebo. Furthermore, PBVC did not differ between the Gilenya and placebo groups. Unsurprisingly, given this agentâ€™s success in reducing relapses and new MRI lesions in RRMS patients, there were fewer new MRI lesions seen in the Gilenya-treated patients. The safety results were generally consistent with this medication in prior MS trials. It is certainly disappointing that Gilenya did not significantly slow disease progression in PPMS. These findings, like those of Tysabri in SPMS, have important implications for the understanding of progressive disease, and will no doubt allow researchers to refine how this is studied moving forward. Another ongoing Gilenya clinical trial is a Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of Two Doses of Fingolimod Versus Copaxone. 3 This 12-month trial will compare the marketed dose of Gilenya with one-half this dose, using Copaxone as a comparison, on annual MS relapses and several MRI measures of disease. The goal of this study, which was required by the FDA, is to assess if a lower dose of this medication may be equally effective at reducing the number of relapses in patients with relapsing forms of MS. This study is expected to report data in 2016. Previous: Tysabri | Next: Laquinimod",gilenya,2,,,

"EYLEA U.S. net product sales $ 359 $ 314 14% Total revenues $ 626 $ 440 42% Non-GAAP net income $ 263 $ 201 31% Non-GAAP net income per share - diluted $ 2.26 $ 1.78 27% GAAP net income $ 65 $ 99 (34%) GAAP net income per share - diluted $ 0.58 $ 0.90 (36%) Business Highlights EYLEA Â® (aflibercept) Injection for Intravitreal Injection In the first quarter of 2014, net sales of EYLEA in  the United States increased 14% to  $359 million from  $314 million in the first quarter of 2013. Net sales in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by a decrease in distributor inventory, while net sales in the first quarter of 2013 benefited from an increase in distributor inventory. Excluding these changes in inventory, underlying demand for EYLEA in  the United States increased by over 25% year over year.  Bayer HealthCare LLC commercializes EYLEA outside the United States. In the first quarter of 2014, net sales of EYLEA outside of  the United States (1) were  $218 million , compared to  $62 million in the first quarter 2013. In the first quarter of 2014, Regeneron recognized  $61 million from its share of net profit from EYLEA sales outside  the United States , after repayment of  $14 million in development expenses. The target date for an  FDA decision on the supplemental BLA for U.S. regulatory approval of EYLEA for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) is  August 18 , 2014. Applications for marketing approval in the  European Union and  Japan for EYLEA in DME have also been submitted. In  February 2014 , the Company reported positive two year results from the Phase 3 VISTA-DME trial for the treatment of DME. During the first quarter of 2014, the Company's supplemental BLA for U.S. regulatory approval of EYLEA for the treatment of macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) was accepted by the  FDA ; the target date for an  FDA decision on this supplemental BLA is  October 23, 2014 . In  February 2014 , the Company initiated a Phase 1 trial of EYLEA in combination with REGN2176, an antibody to Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta (PDGFR-beta), in a co-formulated intravitreal injection, for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). In  January 2014 , the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with  Bayer HealthCare for the joint development and commercialization outside  the United States of REGN2176, including in combination with EYLEA, for the treatment of ocular diseases and disorders. In  May 2014 , the Company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with  Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc. to discover, develop, and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases. Monoclonal Antibodies Regeneron has fifteen fully human monoclonal antibodies generated using the Company's VelocImmune Â® technology in clinical development, including eight in collaboration with Sanofi. Highlights from the late-stage antibody pipeline include:  Alirocumab , the Company's antibody targeting PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) to lower LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), is currently being evaluated in the global Phase 3 ODYSSEY program. The ODYSSEY program is expected to enroll more than 23,000 patients and currently includes 14 clinical trials of alirocumab both in combination with other lipid-lowering agents and as monotherapy. All of the trials in the ODYSSEY program are studying every two week dosing of alirocumab, except for CHOICE I and CHOICE II which are studying every four week dosing. All of the trials in the ODYSSEY program, including CHOICE I and CHOICE II, are fully enrolled with the exception of the 18,000 patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study. Data from nine of these Phase 3 trials are expected to be available in mid-2014 and, along with the data from the previously announced ODYSSEY MONO trial, will form the basis for the Company's initial global regulatory filings. Five abstracts for alirocumab were presented at the  American College of Cardiology meeting in March 2014. These included the first presentation of data from the positive Phase 3 ODYSSEY MONO trial, data from the one-year open-label treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients, and data from testing alirocumab with 150 milligrams (mg) dosed every four weeks in patients who are not on statins. In addition, in  April 2014 , the Company and Sanofi reported positive results from the first Phase 2 study of alirocumab in Japanese patients.  Sarilumab , the Company's antibody targeting IL-6R for rheumatoid arthritis, is currently continuing enrollment in the global Phase 3 SARIL-RA program. The SARIL-RA Phase 3 program consists of 5 studies and is expected to enroll approximately 2,600 adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have not achieved adequate results with other treatment agents. Data from the first positive Phase 3 trial in the SARIL-RA program, MOBILITY, will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.  Dupilumab , the Company's antibody targeting IL-4R alpha for allergic diseases, is currently in Phase 2b testing. During the first quarter of 2014, positive Phase 2a data of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were presented at the annual meeting of the  American Academy of Allergy , Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI). The Company expects Phase 2b data for dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis to become available during the second quarter of 2014. A phase 2b trial of dupilumab in asthma is ongoing, as is a Phase 2 trial in nasal polyposis. Additional indications for dupilumab clinical development are being evaluated. Human Genetics Initiative In  January 2014 , the Company announced the launch of a new human genetics initiative via a newly created wholly owned subsidiary,  Regeneron Genetics Center LLC (RGC). RGC will leverage de-identified clinical and molecular data from human volunteers for medically relevant associations in a blinded fashion designed to preserve patients' privacy. RGC will perform sequencing and genotyping to generate de-identified genomic data. The objective of RGC is to expand the use of human genetics for discovering and validating genetic factors that cause or influence a range of diseases where there are major unmet medical needs, with the prospect of improving the drug discovery and development process. In  January 2014 , the Company also announced that  RGC and Geisinger Health System , one of the largest integrated health systems in  the United States serving approximately 3 million residents, entered into a research collaboration focused on studying the genetic determinants of human disease. The aim of the collaboration is to build a high-throughput platform for discovering and validating genetic factors that cause or influence a range of diseases where there are major unmet medical needs. First Quarter 2014 Financial Results Product Revenues: Net product sales were $362 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $319 million in the first quarter of 2013. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $359 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $314 million in the first quarter of 2013. ARCALYST Â® net product sales were $3 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2013. Total Revenues: Total revenues increased by 42% to $626 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $440 million in the first quarter of 2013. Total revenues include collaboration revenues of $256 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2013. Collaboration revenues increased primarily due to an increase in the Company's net profit from commercialization of EYLEA outside the United States and higher reimbursement of antibody development costs by Sanofi. Collaboration revenues in the first quarter of 2014 also included $30 million of sales milestones earned from Bayer HealthCare . Refer to Table 4 for a summary of collaboration revenue. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: GAAP R&D expenses were $287 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $180 million in the first quarter of 2013. The higher R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2014 were principally due to increased R&D activities, primarily related to the Company's antibody collaboration with Sanofi, higher R&D headcount, and higher non-cash share-based compensation expense. In the first quarter of 2014, R&D-related non-cash share-based compensation expense was $43 million , compared to $27 million in the first quarter of 2013. Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: GAAP SG&A expenses were $109 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $77 million in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher expenses in connection with contributions to a not-for-profit organization that assists patients with chronic disease conditions and higher non-cash compensation expense. In the first quarter of 2014, SG&A-related non-cash share-based compensation expense was $38 million , compared to $26 million in the first quarter of 2013. Cost of Collaboration Manufacturing: GAAP cost of collaboration manufacturing was $16 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $1 million in the first quarter of 2013. Cost of collaboration manufacturing increased primarily due to royalties payable to a third party, which commenced in May 2013 pursuant to a license and settlement agreement, in connection with sales of EYLEA outside the United States. Cost of collaboration manufacturing also includes costs of producing commercial supplies of EYLEA for Bayer HealthCare and ZALTRAP for Sanofi. Income Tax Expense: The Company does not currently pay, or expect to pay in the near future, significant cash income taxes. GAAP income tax expense was $110 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $43 million in the first quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate was 62.7% for first quarter of 2014, compared to 30.3% for the first quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by (i) expiration at the end of 2013 of the federal tax credit for increased research activities, (ii) losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions with rates lower than the federal statutory rate, and (iii) recently enacted New York State tax legislation. This tax legislation reduced the Company's New York State income tax rate to zero percent effective in 2014; however, it also resulted in a one-time charge related to the Company reducing its related deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2014. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2013 included the impact of The American Taxpayer Relief Act, which was enacted in January 2013 , and retroactively extended various expiring tax provisions, including the credit for increased research activities. As a result, during the first quarter of 2013, the Company recognized the benefit of its full year 2012 federal research tax credit. Non-GAAP net income excludes income tax expense. Non-GAAP and GAAP Net Income: The Company reported non-GAAP net income of $263 million , or $2.66 per basic share and $2.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2014, compared to non-GAAP net income of $201 million , or $2.07 per basic share and $1.78 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2013. The Company reported GAAP net income of $65 million , or $0.66 per basic share and $0.58 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2014, compared to GAAP net income of $99 million , or $1.02 per basic share and $0.90 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in GAAP net income resulted primarily from the Company's higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2014, as described above. Cash Position: At March 31, 2014 , cash and marketable securities totaled $1.183 billion , compared to $1.084 billion at December 31 , 2013.  (1) Regeneron records net product sales of EYLEA in the United States. Outside the United States, EYLEA net product sales comprise sales by  Bayer HealthCare in countries other than  Japan and sales by  Santen Pharmaceuticals in  Japan under a co-promotion agreement with a Japanese subsidiary of  Bayer HealthCare . The Company recognizes its share of the profits (including a percentage on sales in  Japan ) from EYLEA sales outside  the United States within ""  Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue"" in its Statements of Operations.  (2) This press release uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because they exclude, as applicable, (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense which fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company's control, such as the Company's stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued, (ii) non-cash interest expense related to the Company's convertible senior notes since this is not deemed useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance, and (iii) income tax expense, since the Company does not currently pay, or expect to pay in the near future, significant cash income taxes due primarily to the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards; therefore, GAAP income tax expense is not deemed useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Any non-GAAP financial measure presented by Regeneron should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay more accurately selected patients eligible to receive anakinase lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment compared with another commonly used immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, the 5A4 IHC assay, a study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology has shown. 1 For the study, researchers sought to compare the 2 widely used IHC assays in lung adenocarcinoma samples. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and IHC with the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay with the OptiView Amplification Kit and a standard IHC test with the clone 5A4 were performed on 1031 lung adenocarcinomas . Next-generation sequencing was performed in samples with inconsistent results between FISH and IHC. Results showed that the FDA-approved IHC assay had a sensitivity of 90.9% Â± 2.6%, specificity of 99.8% Â± 0.6%, positive predictive values of 93.8% Â± 2.1%, and negative predictive values of 99.7% Â±0.6%, while the 5A4 IHC assay had a sensitivity of 90.9% Â± 2.6%), specificity of 98.3% Â± 1.3%, positive predictive value of 63.8% Â± 4.2%, and negative predictive value of 97.7% Â± 0.6%. These findings suggest a high degree of false positives with the 5A4 IHC assay. Next-generation sequencing was performed in 5 samples in which FISH and IHC data differed. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the FISH data, suggesting that there were a very low proportion of patients that had ALK rearrangements that were negative at the ALK protein expression level, and a low percentage of patients without detectable ALK rearrangements that are ALK protein expression-positive.  RELATED: Durvalumab Plus Tremelimumab Active in Lung Cancer The study also demonstrated a 100% response rate to ALK inhibitors in FISH-negative/IHC analysis-positive cases and a 46% response rate in FISH-positive/IHC analysis-negative cases.

"Evening all! Hope everyone's as well as can be! I've just had my results from my most recent MRI and I have new lesions showing. I'm currently on Rebif 44mcg and have been for the last 6 years. Now, I've had a pretty stressful couple of years losing my husband in 2014 and the following year my Dad was diagnosed with bowel cancer. This year I've had to go through my PIP renewal and have had that stopped so all in all it's been a bit rubbish! I'm going to put this new activity down to this but after speaking to my MS nurse she thinks that it may be time to switch meds. This is the first new lesions I've had since being on Rebif so could it be the stress that's caused them and not my meds becoming less effective? The nurse mentioned possibly changing me to either Gilenya or Tysabri and said I should maybe do a bit of reading or ask around for people's experiences before I go to the hospital to see the neurologist. So, does anyone have any experience of either of these (I'm sure many of you do!) and can you tell me of the experience of starting them, if you had any of the side effects, did they wear off, that kind of thing? xx",gilenya,2,,,
"Hi five, Welcome to GRACE. Iâ€™m sorry to hear of your stepmomâ€™s diagnosis. Your post raises a few questions which may affect future treatment decisions. Was her treatment with Alimta effective, and did she stop Alimta due to progression of the cancer, or did it progress later? Has she shown progression on Keytruda, and is it growing slowly or more rapidly? With stage IV disease, itâ€™s not usual to expect that all evidence of the disease disappears, although a small number of patients do achieve this status. Instead, tumor shrinkage or stability is a good result from treatment, and even slow growth with a tolerable agent may be acceptable. You want to get the maximum benefit from each treatment before moving on to another line of therapy. And with an immunotherapy such as Keytruda, some patients donâ€™t show benefit immediately, and some patients derive a long-lasting benefit after only a few treatments. So based on what youâ€™ve said I wouldnâ€™t assume that itâ€™s time for a therapy change, especially since some oncologists change treatments at the first sign of even minor progression. It would be helpful to know if her cancer cells were ever tested for EGFR, ALK or other targetable genetic alterations, as there are approved drugs such as Tarceva and Xalkori, as well as agents targeting other mutations currently being tested in clinical trials. Combinations of immunotherapy agents are also under study, and there are a number of conventional chemotherapy agents available if she needs to change treatments. Let us know if you have answers for any of the questions Iâ€™ve raised, and weâ€™ll try to provide additional information.

"Honestly, it's the same way with cancer patients. Since diseases like cancer and UC have a knack for coming back and seem to go dormant more than they seem to disappear, the word ""cure"" is touchy, and ""remission"" is preferred. Cure is ""it's gone, it's never coming back, it's demolished. I'm completely rid of this disease"" - Remission is more so ""I'm not having symptoms and the disease is seemingly suspended"". Which I feel is a more accurate depiction of what UC patients can get themselves into versus a total end-all cure. I feel as though the word itself can be a disservice to the UC community. Many of us, getting into remission is a dream, and seems almost impossible on our worst days. Achieving remission, and throwing the ""cure"" word around isn't an excellent idea, in my opinion. I know it's just a word. But UC is for life, whether you're currently having symptoms or not, and that's a very real reality that you need to be mentally prepared for. It's better to hope for the best and expect the worst, then expect the best and be trashed by the worst. Educating yourself and being aware of the reality of your disease and it's patient statistics is key. Also, the ""cure"" nonsense is typically a spam buzzword. So I understand that aspect of it as well. 27 years old - Female Diagnosed - December 2017/Ulcerative Pancolitis (Spent December-February in the hospital) Treatments: Remicade (severe liver damage, stopped treatment immediately) Prednisone (caused severe weight gain as well as swollen feet and legs, become non-responsive) Valcyte (to kill my CMV infection) Tacrolimus (bridging biologic medication) Entyvio (currently on dose #3)",remicade,1,,,
"Information compiled by Susan Wells Courtney Reviewed by Jack Burks, MD, MSAAâ€™s Chief Medical Officer Article summary: Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which is the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). The reactivation of this virus causes a painful rash with clusters of fluid-filled blisters. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of shingles, causing chronic, sometimes excruciating pain. The shingles vaccine (ZostavaxÂ®) is recommended for use in people 60 years and older to reduce the risk of shingles. The shingles vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine, which could be an issue for members of the MS population, as medications that may modulate or suppress the immune system could pose a risk with a live vaccine. Individuals with MS who are considering a shingles vaccine should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor. Please note: portions of this article also appear in MSAAâ€™s article, â€œ Vaccine Safety and MS â€  Shingles (Herpes Zoster) Overview Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which is the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). This usually occurs decades after the initial chickenpox infection. The reactivation of this virus causes a painful rash with clusters of fluid-filled blisters. Shingles is not contagious, but before the blisters dry, the virus-filled fluid can transmit chickenpox to someone who has not been previously exposed to the virus and comes in close contact with the open rash. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills, and an upset stomach. Lasting for weeks, months, or even years, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of shingles, and can cause chronic, sometimes excruciating pain in the area where the rash occurred. This chronic, debilitating pain varies from mild to severe, disrupting oneâ€™s sleep, mood, and activities of daily living. PHN can reduce oneâ€™s quality of life, potentially leading to social withdrawal and depression; even suicide has been reported. Scarring is another potential long-term complication of shingles, and in rare cases, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death. While most people only have one episode of shingles, second and third episodes are possible. For older individuals with MS, the risk of shingles and its complications is just as great as for those without MS â€“ and for individuals with MS who take immunosuppressive medications, the associated risks become even greater. Everyoneâ€™s risk of shingles greatly increases as they get older, particularly after the age of 50. The risk of developing PHN (causing continued chronic pain) as a complication of shingles increases with age, as does the likelihood of experiencing longer lasting and more severe pain with PHN. Additionally, individuals with compromised or suppressed immune systems are also more likely to experience complications from shingles.  The Shingles Vaccine According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the vaccine for shingles (also known as herpes zoster or zoster) is recommended for use in people 60 years and older to reduce the risk of shingles. This includes everyone in this age group who has no contraindications, as well as people who have had a previous episode of shingles and/or have chronic medical conditions. (The specific â€œchronic medical conditionsâ€ listed by the CDC include kidney failure, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pulmonary disease.) The shingles vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 and is marketed under the brand name ZostavaxÂ®. The shingles vaccine is given in one dose, subcutaneously (under the skin) in the arm. Common side effects from the vaccine include redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the shot site; and headache. After receiving the vaccination, individuals may be around infants and young children, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems; no reports have been made of someone getting chickenpox from another person who received the shingles vaccine. Some people may develop a chickenpox-like rash near the injection site. If this occurs, simply as a precaution, the rash should be covered until it disappears. The shingles vaccine does not contain thimerosal, which is a preservative that contains mercury and is sometimes used in vaccines. No serious adverse events have been seen with the shingles vaccine, which has been tested in approximately 20,000 people (without MS) age 60 and older. The vaccine appears to be effective for at least six years, but may last longer. While older individuals may get the vaccine at any age, it appears to be the most effective in people 60 to 69 years. Studies have found that the shingles vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 51 percent in older adults, reduced the risk of PHN by 67 percent, and also reduced the severity and duration of pain associated with PHN. The safety of the shingles vaccine is more difficult to judge for individuals with MS. The current data supporting its use are reassuring, but not complete because this vaccine has not been fully investigated in MS. The shingles vaccine has been more thoroughly investigated in other illnesses, including patients whose immune system may be compromised by their disease or by the drugs used to treat their disease. The shingles vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine, which can be an issue for individuals with MS. Many vaccines use viruses that have been inactivated (i.e., killed), so the virus has no chance of infecting anyone. The shingles vaccine contains live viruses, but these have been â€œattenuated,â€ meaning that their strength has been reduced to a point where they canâ€™t infect someone with a healthy, uncompromised immune system. As with many individuals with various other health conditions, a large number of individuals with MS take medications that may modulate or suppress their immune system. A live-virus vaccine may conceivably be able to infect someone whose immune system is not fully functioning, a result of either an illness or medications given to treat an illness. In addition to some of the FDA-approved long-term disease-modifying therapies for MS, large doses or extended use of steroids, which are frequently prescribed to treat MS relapses, can also suppress the immune system. Less common treatments to be considered when evaluating the safety of the shingles vaccine include: experimental treatments for MS, such as those being studied in clinical trials with MS patients; off-label treatments, such as methotrexate and ImuranÂ® (azathioprine); hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); and antiviral medications.  Guidelines for Shingles Vaccine Safety According to an extensive report from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Harpaz R., et al, 2006), different treatments need to be considered before the shingles vaccine may be considered safe for an individual. This report originated in the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and the Division of Viral Diseases, both a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To follow are some general guidelines. As a reminder, individuals are strongly advised to consult their physician on the safety of the shingles vaccine, as doctors need to look at each personâ€™s situation on a case-by-case basis. Individuals who should not get the shingles vaccine, or who should wait, include: Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or another component of the shingles vaccine An individual with a weakened immune system because of HIV/AIDS or other disease affecting the immune system, or someone who takes a medication that weakens the immune system People on immunosuppressive therapy, including high-dose corticosteroids (20 mg or more per day of prednisone or equivalent) lasting two or more weeks, should wait for at least one month after discontinuing the therapy Anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness (including anyone with a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit or higher) should usually wait until they recover before getting a vaccine Individuals who may receive the vaccine include: Anyone with a minor acute illness (such as a cold) may be vaccinated People receiving short-term corticosteroid therapy: for less than two weeks; in a low-to-moderate dose (less than 20 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent); topically (such as those given via nasal, skin, or inhaled administration); or long-term alternate-day treatment with low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic corticosteroids â€“ these are all considered to not suppress the immune system enough to cause concerns for vaccine safety Therapy with low-doses of methotrexate (equal to or less than 0.4mg/Kg/week) or azathioprine (equal to or less than 3.0 mg/Kg/day) is considered to not suppress the immune system enough to cause concerns for vaccine safety Special groups and circumstances: People who have previously had shingles may be vaccinated, although they need to wait until the rash is cleared People with a normal immune system who are anticipating immunosuppression* (please see next bullet point), without a prior shingles vaccine, should receive the vaccine as soon as possible, while their immunity is intact; the vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, although some experts advise waiting one month *According to MSAA Chief Medical Officer Jack Burks, MD, â€œMost MS drugs are not considered immunosuppressive, but are considered immunomodulating, which affects the immune system differently. Nonetheless, we recommend that patients consult with their doctor regarding this CDC recommendation. For example, the recommendation for GilenyaÂ® (fingolimod) is immunization 30 days before starting Gilenya.â€ In regards to individuals receiving recombinant human immune mediators and immune modulators (especially the antitumor necrosis factor agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept), the safety and efficacy of the shingles vaccine administered concurrently is unknown. If not possible to administer the vaccine before initiation of therapy, patients should have their immune status assessed by their physician to determine the relevant risks and benefits. Otherwise, vaccination should be deferred for at least one month after stopping the medication. (This category would include the MS medication TysabriÂ® [natalizumab], as well as many of the experimental therapies presently in clinical trials, such as LemtradaÂ® [alemtuzumab, formerly Campath], daclizumab [also known as ZenapaxÂ®], RituxanÂ® [rituximab], ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab [also known as ArzerraÂ®].  Individuals taking one of these drugs are advised to talk to their doctor, who can assess the risks and benefits of the shingles vaccine in conjunction with this type of disease-modifying therapy.) People receiving blood products (including antibody-containing blood products) may receive the shingles vaccine at any time before, during or after; the list includes intravenous immune globulin (IVIG); plasma exchange would also fall under this category, but is not specified in the report;  patients receiving these types of treatment are advised to consult their physician before getting a shingles vaccine Experience with individuals undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is limited and should be considered on a case-by-case basis; patients should have their immune status assessed by their physician to determine the relevant risks and benefits; if a shingles vaccine has been approved, it should not be administered until at least two years (24 months) after transplantation Antiviral medications may interfere with the replication of the live-virus vaccine, so anyone taking ZoviraxÂ® (acyclovir), FamvirÂ® (famciclovir), or ValtrexÂ® (valacyclovir) regularly, should discontinue these medications at least 24 hours before administration of the shingles vaccine, if possible. These medications should not be used for at least 14 days after vaccination.  Additional Notes about the Shingles Vaccine According to the CDC, the shingles vaccine may be given simultaneously with other vaccines, including the flu vaccine. Each vaccine must be administered using separate syringes and different injection sites. If other vaccines are not administered at the same time, the shingles vaccine may still be given at any time before or after other vaccines â€“ provided these are inactivated vaccines. If receiving another live, attenuated vaccine (in addition to the shingles vaccine), and are not doing so at the same time, patients need to wait at least four weeks before or after the shingles vaccine, to receive a different live, attenuated vaccine. The shingles vaccine is not recommended for anyone who has received the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine. However, the chickenpox vaccine did not become available in the United States until 1995, so virtually all people who have received a vaccination against chickenpox are too young to receive a shingles vaccine. For this reason, The CDC states that healthcare providers do not need to inquire about oneâ€™s varicella vaccination history, since virtually all persons in the recommended age group (and for at least the next decade) did not receive a chickenpox vaccine. Additionally, the CDC notes that anyone 60 or older (without any contraindications) should get the vaccine, regardless of whether or not he or she can remember having had chickenpox. Studies show that 99.5 percent of Americans age 40 and over have had chickenpox. Patients do not need to be asked about their history of chickenpox or have their blood tested for antibodies.  Insurance Coverage and Resources The following information is provided on the CDCâ€™s website . The shingles vaccine is available in pharmacies and doctorsâ€™ offices. To find local facilities that offer the vaccine, please visit www.zostavax.com . All Medicare Part D plans cover the shingles vaccine; the cost-sharing for vaccination varies. Medicare Part B does not cover the shingles vaccine. Medicaid may or may not cover the vaccine. Most private health insurance plans cover the vaccine for people age 60 and over; some cover people age 50 to 59. The Merck Vaccine Patient Assistance Program provides free vaccines to eligible adults (usually individuals without insurance).

"Today I met with my oncologist and had my 3rd trip to the ""juice bar"" for another 240mg bag of Opdivo (nivo). Two weeks ago right after my 2nd infusion, I had a full body check by my dermatologist as I had a fast appearing lesion on the back of my right hand, and I was a bit paniced. She punch biopsied it, and 3 other moles. Was a difficult wait for four days until the pathology came back, but praise the Lord, all were negative for our evil enemy Mel. I was kinda suprised based on all of the other high risk pathologies. So.... Not sure, but I think I am NED, having the primary and 3 lmph node tumors all disected as well as all of the suspicious growths on me removed. The onc said probably won't do another PET-CT scan for a few months, just stay on the bi-weekly Opdivo infusions, and 3 month checks by dermatologist, and lymph node checks every 3 months. Also, I am seemingly not having much issue with my Opdivo slug, I feel a bit tired for a day with some mild nausea. My blood work looks great too for the last three pre-infusion checks. It seems like its been a long road since November when this deal with the devil Mel started, and it has been. But it is nice to see for the time being things are going my way. Since following this forum group I see our new members coming in with all of the anxiety and and fear of what road is in front of them, just like I did. I just want to say, find comfort here from those much further down life's road with Mel, it has really helped me through these wicked few months. Peace",opdivo,2,,,
"My husband was diagnosed with sclc in February of 2018 (almost a year ago). He had a couple of pretty large tumors in his right lung (inoperable) and lymph node involvement as well. He began chemo treatments a week after diagnosis and they used carboplatin and etoposide. He had 4 cycles that were 3 days each. Starting with his second cycle he also began radiation on his tumors. 30 treatments, 2 a day for15 straight days. Then had 10 low dose brain radiation treatments (PCI). It all lasted from February to July of 2018. You are correct about the tethering statement as we have practically lived at the cancer center. The cancer has now metastasized to his liver and he has undergone two more cycles of chemo now along with one of the new immunotherapy drugs, TECENTRIQ. He had 6 liver tumors which 4 are gone now and the remaining 2 are 50% smaller. He has had TECENTRIQ 3 times and is tolerating it fairly well. They have now found a spot on his rib bone so have stopped chemo but are continuing Tesentriq and adding a drug called zometa for bone strength. He will get scans every 2 months now instead of every 3 like he had in the beginning. The decision is ultimately yours and your familyâ€™s, of course, but we both would recommend you do treatments. Our family has had the blessing of him still being with us for almost a year now, when it appeared to be a very grim situation in the beginning as Iâ€™m sure it is for you right now. It has been VERY hard on him (and me too) but would we take the same course again, knowing and going through what we have? He and I both say yes!!! I will tell you the honest truth. He was hospitalized 3 times, low sodium, needing blood transfusions, and got sepsis on top of all that! Heâ€™s always been a very strong man. A brick mason. A weaker person may not have been able to endure all that heâ€™s had to endure and I really believe strength is important for these types of treatments. But, for any side effect, they usually have something that will help too though. Itâ€™s a very hard road to go down but I would recommend that you do it. Any extra time you get is a blessing and every day they are finding new immunotherapy drugs to help sclc. Despite the extremely rough journey there is always hope. Everyone responds differently too so you could have an easier time of it than my husband has. Take care and the very best of luck to you. If you are near an MD Anderson facility, my husband and I would strongly recommend them too. I hope sharing his story has helped you. Keep us updated.",tecentriq,2,,,

BACKGROUND: The treatment of multiple sclerosis has changed over the last 20 years. The advent of disease-modifying drugs in the mid-1990s heralded a period of rapid progress in the understanding and management of multiple sclerosis. With the support of magnetic resonance imaging early diagnosis is possible, enabling treatment initiation at the time of the first clinical attack. As most of the disease-modifying drugs are associated with adverse events, patients and clinicians need to weigh the benefit and safety of the various early treatment options before taking informed decisions. OBJECTIVES: 1. to estimate the benefit and safety of disease-modifying drugs that have been evaluated in all studies (randomised or non-randomised) for the treatment of a first clinical attack suggestive of MS compared either with placebo or no treatment; 2. to assess the relative efficacy and safety of disease-modifying drugs according to their benefit and safety; 3. to estimate the benefit and safety of disease-modifying drugs that have been evaluated in all studies (randomised or non-randomised) for treatment started after a first attack ('early treatment') compared with treatment started after a second attack or at another later time point ('delayed treatment'). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, the WHO trials registry, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports, and searched for unpublished studies (until December 2016). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and observational studies that evaluated one or more drugs as monotherapy in adult participants with a first clinical attack suggestive of MS. We considered evidence on alemtuzumab, azathioprine, cladribine, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer acetate, immunoglobulins, interferon beta-1b, interferon beta-1a (RebifÂ®, AvonexÂ®), laquinimod, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon beta-1a, rituximab and teriflunomide. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two teams of three authors each independently selected studies and extracted data. The primary outcomes were disability-worsening, relapses, occurrence of at least one serious adverse event (AE) and withdrawing from the study or discontinuing the drug because of AEs. Time to conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS) defined by Poser diagnostic criteria, and probability to discontinue the treatment or dropout for any reason were recorded as secondary outcomes. We synthesized study data using random-effects meta-analyses and performed indirect comparisons between drugs. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) along with relative 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes. We estimated the absolute effects only for primary outcomes. We evaluated the credibility of the evidence using the GRADE system. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 randomised trials, eight open-label extension studies (OLEs) and four cohort studies published between 2010 and 2016. The overall risk of bias was high and the reporting of AEs was scarce. The quality of the evidence associated with the results ranges from low to very low. Early treatment versus placebo during the first 24 months' follow-up: There was a small, non-significant advantage of early treatment compared with placebo in disability-worsening (6.4% fewer (13.9 fewer to 3 more) participants with disability-worsening with interferon beta-1a (RebifÂ®) or teriflunomide) and in relapses (10% fewer (20.3 fewer to 2.8 more) participants with relapses with teriflunomide). Early treatment was associated with 1.6% fewer participants with at least one serious AE (3 fewer to 0.2 more). Participants on early treatment were on average 4.6% times (0.3 fewer to 15.4 more) more likely to withdraw from the study due to AEs. This result was mostly driven by studies on interferon beta 1-b, glatiramer acetate and cladribine that were associated with significantly more withdrawals for AEs. Early treatment decreased the hazard of conversion to CDMS (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.60). Comparing active interventions during the first 24 months' follow-up: Indirect comparison of interferon beta-1a (RebifÂ®) with teriflunomide did not show any difference on reducing disability-worsening (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.66). We found no differences between the included drugs with respect to the hazard of conversion to CDMS. Interferon beta-1a (RebifÂ®) and teriflunomide were associated with fewer dropouts because of AEs compared with interferon beta-1b, cladribine and glatiramer acetate (ORs range between 0.03 and 0.29, with substantial uncertainty). Early versus delayed treatment: We did not find evidence of differences between early and delayed treatments for disability-worsening at a maximum of five years' follow-up (3% fewer participants with early treatment (15 fewer to 11.1 more)). There was important variability across interventions; early treatment with interferon beta-1b considerably reduced the odds of participants with disability-worsening during three and five years' follow-up (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.84 and OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89). The early treatment group had 19.6% fewer participants with relapses (26.7 fewer to 12.7 fewer) compared to late treatment at a maximum of five years' follow-up and early treatment decreased the hazard of conversion to CDMS at any follow-up up to 10 years (i.e. over five years' follow-up HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.73). We did not draw any conclusions on long-term serious AEs or discontinuation due to AEs because of inadequacies in the available data both in the included OLEs and cohort studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very low-quality evidence suggests a small and uncertain benefit with early treatment compared with placebo in reducing disability-worsening and relapses. The advantage of early treatment compared with delayed on disability-worsening was heterogeneous depending on the actual drug used and based on very low-quality evidence. Low-quality evidence suggests that the chances of relapse are [lower] with early treatment compared with delayed. Early treatment reduced the hazard of conversion to CDMS compared either with placebo, no treatment or delayed treatment, both in short- and long-term follow-up. Low-quality evidence suggests that early treatment is associated with fewer participants with at least one serious AE compared with placebo. Very low-quality evidence suggests that, compared with placebo, early treatment leads to more withdrawals or treatment discontinuation due to AEs. Difference between drugs on short-term benefit and safety was uncertain because few studies and only indirect comparisons were available. Long-term safety of early treatment is uncertain because of inadequately reported or unavailable data.",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"From exploring the forums if one thing is clear its that no 2 patients symptoms are the same. But I find myself at a cross roads of starting biologics without having a 100% certainty I do in fact have crohns. In short since 2015 I have had 2-3 flare a year of severe RLQ pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea (loose to watery). Each flare is resolved with 2-3 weeks of steriods and diet modification. I take Lialda for maintenance but still experience RLQ pain almost daily and nausea and vomiting after I eat. Since 2015 I have lost approx 70lbs. Last colon and EGD scope was 2016 with non specific inflammation and nothing to impressive on the biopsy. My last major flare was in June after being off the Lialda for a few months at that time my WBC count was 17K and the CT showed enteritis / ileus in my small bowel with possible colitis. My old GI was somewhat leaning to IBD but reluctant to start any treatment. I felt it was best to get a second opinion, my current GI is fairly certain based on my history and CT findings that I most likely have crohns in my small bowel that is not accessible to the scopes. He feels its best to start Entyvio being that I continue to have symptoms (RLQ pain, low grade temps, nausea vomiting after eating) says he has had patients with the same story. So my question to the forum has anyone else been diagnosed based on symptoms and non specific lab and imaging? Even though its safer of the biologics it does not come with out risk and of course the expense and want to do whatâ€™s best for myself and family.",entyvio,2,,,
"Sorry for the delayed response. Well, overall my UC isn't as bad as some people I've seen with it. I haven't had blood present in any BMs or the sort since my first true flare up back in September/October. According to my GI there was some improvement in what he saw (and overall the Entyvio is the first drug that has actually truly helped me. Not counting the Devil-s TicTacs). I have absolutely noticed a massive quality of life improvement since going on Entyvio in January. One of the main motivators for me getting this surgery was due to the descript ion my doctors gave me. They basically said that once I have the surgery (after recovery time) that its all good. No drugs, no infusions, and essentially, no more UC because, well, I don't have a large intestine anymore. As I look around I notice a lot of people with J-pouches who are still on UC forums and pages. Now I know a lot of those people are there to help others still with the disease, but I wonder I'm trying to get a truly accurate picture of life post-op. I mean why would someone who no longer has a large intestine still be on entyvio and meslamine?(When I tried to ask this person they never responded). Does UC truly go away after this surgery or is it one of those asterisk* kind of situations? [quote]How bad is your disease? Has it reached a point where most of the potential complications wouldn't be any worse than what you have right now, or are the symptoms liveable with? As I mentioned earlier, my disease isn't as detremenal for me as it is for others, but I do have a lot of problems still. I still go more than I feel I should, I am always fatigued and have a screwed up sleep cycle (a lot of this has to do with the drugs I am on-Prednisone being the primary offender). Where I am on the cusp the most is that I am 22 years old. I graduated college a month ago and am trying to start my professional career. I am even in the hiring process for a position right now that If I got it, it would be a year of solid training before graduating the academy. A flare up would be devastating and would ultimately result in me either resigning or being laid off (ADA wouldn't protect me given that its a sworn position apparently). My doctors and parents both feel its best I just have this surgery and be done with it if it truly means that UC, the drugs, flare ups, etc. are all behind me for good. I just really do not want to do this surgery and see my quality of life go backwards.",entyvio,0,,,
"Hi vvd7, Welcome to GRACE. I am sorry to hear of your momâ€™s diagnosis. Her type of cancer is often referred to as â€œmucinous BACâ€, and there is a great deal of information available on this site if you search for that term. BAC does not tend to spread beyond the lungs; in your momâ€™s case the bulky adrenal gland is suspicious, but that could have a non-cancer cause. Some instances of BAC can be very slow growing, so much so that treatment need not be started immediately if at all, although the mucinous form of BAC tends to grow faster. In that regard, treatment that produces tumor stability (as in your momâ€™s case) can be a good result. If her symptoms (blood in her cough, etc.) have improved, that is also a good sign of response to chemo. Follow-up scans will help in assessing the result of treatment and the status of the cancer. If at some point the cancer appears to be growing significantly, there are other options. Although only about 10-20% of patients get a good response to immunotherapy, those who do can respond very well for a long time, so it would certainly be an option, especially since your momâ€™s cancer is EGFR/ALK negative, since a lower percentage of those patients respond well to immunotherapy. Dr. West has also noted that even patients who are EGFR negative may receive some benefit from Tarceva, so at some point that may be an option.  In addition, this type of lung cancer, though not rare, is not seen by any individual oncologist very often. Dr. West estimated that â€œmost oncologists have treated about 3-5 patients with mucinous BAC in the last couple of decadesâ€, while those â€œwho have more experience with BAC [have seen]10-20 patients with mucinous BAC in the past decade or two.â€ â€“ http://cancergrace.org/forums/index.php?topic=8756.msg91242#msg91242  With that in mind, your mom might want to seek a second opinion from an oncologist who is more experienced with mucinous BAC.

"1 June 2016 - The U.S. FDA today approved the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2, a blood-based companion diagnostic for the cancer drug Tarceva (erlotinib hydrochloride). This is the first FDA-approved, blood-based genetic test that can detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Such mutations are present in approximately 10-20 percent of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the U.S. and, though more common in men, the number of deaths from lung cancer in women is increasing. According to the National Cancer Institute, an estimated 221,200 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 158,040 will die from the disease this year. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer. NSCLC tumors may shed tumor DNA into a patientâ€™s blood, making it possible to detect specific mutations in blood samples. Testing for tumor DNA using a blood sample is also called a â€œliquid biopsy.â€ â€œApprovals of liquid biopsy tests make it possible to deliver highly individualized health care for patients,â€ said Alberto Gutierrez, Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDAâ€™s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. â€œLiquid biopsies also have the potential to allow physicians to identify patients whose tumors have specific mutations in the least invasive way possible.â€ For more details, go to: http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm504488.htm",tarceva,2,,,

"That's why - you took it before and then stopped. Usually people who take it and then stop, no matter for how long, develop antibodies. It means that if they try to do an infusion, your body will reject it like an allergic reaction or a virus, and you could get pretty sick. I think that yes, they will almost always be elevated. Once your body makes tons of extra antibodies, they hang out in the bloodstream on patrol for infliximab, which they view as a foreign invader.

"Results from a phase 3 study on pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug) found the combination resulted in significantly longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy alone, reducing the risk of death by about 50% in patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . 1 These data, presented during the American Association for Cancer Research, confirmed an earlier phase 2 study's findings. Lead author Leena Gandhi, MD, of New York University Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health in New Yok, said these data will â€œunequivocallyâ€ alter how clinicians treat this type of NSCLC. Before this study, first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC that lacks targetable mutations (such as EGFR or ALK ) is platinum-based chemotherapy; for patients with a tumor proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy. Dr Gandhi, who was also an author of the phase 2 study, said the small numbers in that trial meant her daily practice patterns didn't change as the numbers â€œwere too small to make any definitive conclusions.â€ With 616 patients in the phase 3 study, however, the estimated rate of OS at 12 months was 69.2% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group compared with 49.4% in the placebo-chemotherapy group. Median PFS was 8.8 months in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 4.9 months in the placebo-chemotherapy group. The median OS has not yet been reached in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group. Further, the rates of adverse events were almost identical between the two arms, and were similar in adverse events of grade 3 or higher.

Timely Reporting of Palliative Care Needs Leads to More Appropriate End-of-Life Care in NSCLC Osimertinib Improves Quality-of-Life and Global Health Status in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer â€œThese results were incredibly clear cut,â€ Dr. Gandhi said. â€œIt was an early look and there were very clear differences. There was no question about the results of the study, and there's nothing more to wait for before altering treatment regimens.â€ PD-1, PD-L1 Inhibitors and Chemotherapy Mounting evidence suggests that PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors can be effective in the treatment of NSCLC, she said. For instance, data presented at the same conference on nivolumab and ipilimumab for advanced NSCLC (CheckMate 227; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02477826 ) found the combination significantly prolonged PFS when compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. 2 The KEYNOTE-189 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02578680 )allowed for crossover to pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients who demonstrated disease progression. The benefit of the combination was shown â€œin patients with all levels of PD-L1 expression, even those with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of less than 1%,â€ Dr Gandhi said, although the greatest response rate between group difference was found in patients with a tumor proportion score of 50% or greater (61.4% in the pembrolizumab combination group vs 22.9% in the placebo combination group).",ipilimumab,2,,,
If..it would. The rituximab trial showed profG and others who to put into the trial CD19 does not target most antibody producing plasma cells so again not the best choice. CD38 is an option but CD138 may be better. The extension data says ocrelizumab is still working but there is still worsening. It shows the time is brain clearly as does the relapsing trial extension study. The two years lost time on placebo or interferon has not been caught up.

"An FYI about reading a long article that includes research data/methods, etc.  I often skip a lot of the middle part at least at first and read conclusions and discussions.  Thatâ€™s where clinical research discuss implications for patient use.   Often a break is taken after induction therapy (carbo/taxol/avas) where the person is watched closely by ct scans and physical check up by onc every 6 weeks or so.  So when progression starts it will be caught early enough to treat and you have a chance to recovery from platinum based chemo which will be the most toxic of chemo.  This is a good option for people who want or need a break to recover or go on vacation or sit on the couch without feeling sick.  On the other hand if your oncologist and/or you arenâ€™t comfortable with a break continuing treatment may not be up for discussion.  Thatâ€™s fine too.   The most recent research shows that anyone with any pdl-1 expression over 1% can benefit from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies such as pembrolizamub.  Pembro has shown longer lasting efficacy than cytotoxic agents aka chemo.   If your health system requires you to use chemo until progression before allowing the use of immunotherapy, alimta alone is much much more common than avaistin alone and many people use alimta with avaitin but the until data from the ecog 5508 trial are mature we just donâ€™t know which is best.

"I am not sure that avastin is much different from lucentis or eylea. The basics are the same. It is just that avastin comes in larger phials, suitable for cancer treatment instead of small ones for eye treatment. The manufacturers of this drug have so far refused to produce smaller amounts suitable for eye treatment. This means that another company will transfer the drug into smaller phials, which may increase the risk of contamination and thus infection. In fact, this has actually happened. Avastin was used before lucentis and eylea was developed. Also: I have heard that some patients' treatment has been changed from Avastin to one of the other drugs because it was no longer working.

"Hello, I am 28, female and living in The Netherlands. I was diagnosed in June 2017 (bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia) + migranes + nausea + sensory symptoms. MRI showed 5 non-enhancing brain lesions (one of them in brainstem). Lumbar puncture revealed the presence of oligoclonal bands. INO resolved but I still have some mild sensory symptoms and fatigue. 3-month followup MRI (end of Aug) showed no changes in lesion load/volume. Started with 40mg Copaxone end of September. Question nr 1: Dr recommended MRI at 12 months after Copaxone start, but should I also maybe rebaseline at 6 months after Copaxone start (right before it reaches therapeutic levels)? Because if any lesions are found at 12 months how can I know whether they were created before or after Cop started working? Question 2: Would I be a good candidate for Cladribine or Alemtuzumab?

"Hi, My dad was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC with bone metastasis about Sept 2013. He started taking Irressa in Nov 2013. In Feb 2015, he progressed on Iressa and entered the AZD9291 trial. Currently, the 2nd EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 is working well and he is stable. Itâ€™s been close to two year since he started taking AZD9291, which is amazing but also worring for me. Eventually, he will progress on AZD9291 and we will have to explore options. I understand most of the immunotherpy drugs are not effective for EGFR mutation patients. Also, there are single agents like Keytruda and combination of agents. Just wondering what are the options currently available right now.  Many thanks! Fischer",keytruda,2,,,
"Hi Christina, I suggest you speak to the Macular Society. There's tel & email contact on their website. I too thought csr & wetmd separate conditions , although like brvo can cause the same damage problems on the macular. I don't know if treatment is the same ( eg with brvo they can give steroid implant which wetmd sufferers can't benefit from). I suppose it's possible you have been incredibly unlucky and developed two separate conditions. Or maybe one is an eventual trigger for the other. To have csr for ten years with no treatment sounds odd to me but I don't know anything about it other than stress makes it worse. There's a lot the drs don't seem to know too and we all respond differently so there's often not a clear path. Lucentis is specifically formulated for the eye ( like eyelea) unlike avastin so although more expensive is generally preferred from the whole body perspective . Also, the loading dose with the ' proper' inj is 3 before they check. When I was having inj I often got central blurriness for that day but it would go. Other blurriness would come later when oedema was returning or worsening. Personally, if Lucentis is known to be a treatment for csr, and my sight was worsening noticeably I would give it a go. There are people on here who may have personal experience to share with you which will be more useful I suspect! Best wishes going forward x",lucentis,1,,,

"How Is My MS? I should probably start this off by updating you on my current health status so that we can all sort of be on the same page regarding the current state of my MS. The whole â€œoscillopsia-nystagmus-vertigo vision thingâ€ remains my number one most terrible symptom that is with me every single day. Of course, some days are much worse than others but this symptom has become part of my â€œbaselineâ€ and I have been under the impression for a while now that itâ€™s always going to be there. T his symptom is with me for life . I have definitely learned how to better live with it but that doesnâ€™t really make it any less miserable or debilitating. Although, the â€œdizzy vision thingâ€ sort of has just become part of â€œmy new normalâ€ so the main symptom you might actually hear me complain about most often is my fatigue. Itâ€™s been so heavy since the beginning of 2015 when I had that relapse that really impacted my life in a pretty negative way. Now that I really think about it, I never sit there in a deep depression over my vision and how nothing feels steady. No, itâ€™s always because I almost always feel completely defeated by the severity of my fatigue . I never want to do anything but sit and stare at the wall because I am always just so exhausted . Everything I do, even brushing my teeth or stuff that I would consider fun , requires a mental battle to decide that I can, in fact, muster the energy to move, even while on medication like Nuvigil (armodafinil) or Ritalin (methylphenidate). What If itâ€™s Not Just MS When I first got to Colorado a couple of months ago, I wanted to try to see a general physician about the possibility that something else other than MS was contributing to my abundant level of fatigue. Hemochromatosis runs in my family so maybe I should check for that? Or what about anemia? There are so many possibilities but all the symptoms associated with those things are already causes by MS so what if this whole time I had developed some other health condition but it was totally masked by my MS? Like what if everyone I ever saw just assumed a new occurrence of symptoms was just an MS thing? I have never had to get tested for something and actually hoped that the results would come back positive; I mean, yeah, positive would mean that there was now something other than MS in my life that I had to treat but what if that meant getting to try something that MS had not warranted me trying in the past? Could that be my ticket to relief? A New Neurologist Well, I saw a physician assistant and she ran some labs to check for all that stuff. Negative on the hemochromatosis and anemia ideas and my vitamin D and B12 looked just fine soâ€¦ damn? At this point she referred me to a neurologist because no one wants to touch me after they learn that I have MS; wouldnâ€™t want to mess up and risk me suing you because, â€œyou should have sent me to a neurologistâ€ or something like that, right ? Thatâ€™s probably not the reason but sometimes thatâ€™s how it feels because I canâ€™t ever seem to get an opinion from anyone other than a neurologist who of course is always going to see nothing but MS. So yeah, I have to admit, I really wasnâ€™t all that motivated to call and make an appointment but I was running low on Nuvigil and my neurologistâ€™s office back in California was not returning my calls, messages, or the calls from the pharmacy regarding a refill so I went ahead and made an appointment. That appointment was today and I was preparing myself for the whole â€œfinding a new doctor gameâ€ that plagues so many people living with a chronic illness. You know what game I am talking about; set up an appointment, get to that appointment, realize the doctor is a complete quack that doesnâ€™t want to hear anything from you that suggests you have actually spent even a little time educating yourself about your own disease so that you can make informed decisions regarding your treatment, and then finding another new doctor so you can start the whole process all over again. That game. Well, to my surprise, it was nothing like that, she was actually pretty awesome! She went over my history, refilled all my prescriptions, wrote me some new ones, set me up with Ampyra (which I have not been able to get ahold of for like 5 years), sent out a referral for an MRI (brain, cervical, and spine), talked to me a little about Ocrevus (Ocrelizumab) and even brought up some of the latest MS research topics she learned about while at the latest ECTRIMS (European Committee for Treatment And Research in Multiple Sclerosis). Nothing like what I had expected! I was worried I would be seeing some neurologist who had just graduated and didnâ€™t really know anything about MS other than whatever was in the whole 2 paragraphs of their â€œintroduction to functional anatomy of the brainâ€ textbook that was dedicated to MS. The thing you have to remember is, they spent 12 years in medical school reading books so they are now actually a totally qualified â€œMS specialistâ€, an expert . Hmmmâ€¦ does it sound like I have an issue with newly graduated doctors who think they are a step down from god ? â€¦Nope, I donâ€™t think I do but anyway, the simple fact that she even knew what ECTRIMS was gave me a level of comfort that usually takes me a couple years to build with a medical professional so I am pretty happy.",ocrevus,2,,,

Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months).  Preparation for Administration Eylea should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the vial must not be used.  â€‹ The glass vial is for single use only.  â€‹ Eylea is available packaged as follows:  â€‹ Vial Kit with Injection Components (filter needle, syringe, injection needle)  â€‹ [  see How Supplied (16) ]  . â€‹ Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps:  â€‹ Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use:  â€‹ a 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge Ã— 1Â½-inch)  â€‹ a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL)  â€‹ a sterile injection needle (30-gauge Ã— Â½-inch) Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see  Figure 1 ).   Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see  Figure 2 ).   â€‹ Remove the 19-gauge Ã— 1Â½-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see  Figure 3 ).   Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the Eylea vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see  Figures 4a and  4b ).   Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle.  Note : Filter needle is  not to be used for intravitreal injection.  â€‹ Remove the 30-gauge Ã— Â½-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see  Figure 5 ).   When ready to administer Eylea, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see  Figure 6 ).   To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger so that the plunger tip aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (see  Figures 7a and  7b ).   Injection Procedure The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broadâ€“spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [  see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before Eylea is administered to the other eye. After injection, any unused product must be discarded.  Dosage Forms and Strengths Injection: 2 mg/0.05 mL clear, colorless to pale yellow solution in a single-dose, glass vial for intravitreal injection.  Contraindications Ocular or Periocular Infections Eylea is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections.  Active Intraocular Inflammation Eylea is contraindicated in patients with active intraocular inflammation.  Hypersensitivity Eylea is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or any of the excipients in Eylea. Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as rash, pruritus, urticaria, severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, or severe intraocular inflammation.  Warnings and Precautions Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections, including those with Eylea, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering Eylea. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [  see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ].  Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with Eylea [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [  see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ].  Thromboembolic Events â€‹ There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including Eylea. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with Eylea compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the Eylea group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with Eylea compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with Eylea compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with Eylea in the first six months of the RVO studies.

"Upal Basu Roy, MPH, PhD, Director of Translational Research Program/Director of Patient FoRCe at LUNGevity September 2018 ended with a bang! The 19th World Conference for Lung Cancer was hosted in Toronto, summer unofficially ended in New York, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved another drug, dacomitinib, for lung cancer â€¦ I am sure I am missing a few things. This yearâ€™s World Conference on Lung Cancer (or World Lung, as itâ€™s fondly referred to) was the biggest World Lung ever convenedâ€”over 7,000 delegates from 100 countries attended. More importantly, the meeting showcased a number of practice-changing scientific presentationsâ€”too many for me to just list. Therefore, I am going to try and categorize them into themes.  Change is on the horizon Practice-changing science pertinent to the entire patient journey, from screening to treatment, was presented. As you all may be aware, lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is available in the US to individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer. This is, however, not the case in Europe and other parts of the world. Results from the NELSON trial from Europe that were disclosed at the meeting will soon change this. This trial, which was set up to determine the benefits of LDCT for lung cancer screening, enrolled 15,792 patients and clearly demonstrated the benefit of CT screening to men at high risk for lung cancer. The benefit was even more pronounced in women. The study reinforces the population-level benefits of LDCT and also lays the groundwork for additional studies to look at gender differences in lung cancer. In terms of lung cancer therapies, exciting news for ALK-positive lung cancer! A clinical trial with brigatinib, an ALK inhibitor that is currently approved for those patients who have progressed on crizotinib, shows that this drug works really well in the first-line settingâ€“even for those patients who have brain metastases. Soon, ALK-positive lung cancer patients may have a new first-line treatment option. LUNGevity Scientific Advisory Board member Dr. Scott Antonia presented updated results from the PACIFIC trial testing immunotherapy with chemotherapy and radiation (chemoradiation) for Stage III non-small lung cancer patients (NSCLC). The new results show that adding a checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, to chemoradiation provides a clear survival benefit to stage III NSCLC patients. This is big news, given that Stage III patients are a unique subset of NSCLC patients with very few treatment options. Last but not least, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) may be scoring a big win. Results from the IMpower 133 clinical trial show that the addition of an immunotherapy drug, atezolizumab, to the standard chemotherapy regimen for SCLC is beneficial. The standard of care for SCLC has been chemotherapy for the past 30 years, so this is indeed a big deal!  Collaboration is the key to change Of course, change isnâ€™t possible without collaboration. Lung cancer is a complex disease that requires multiple stakeholders to be at the table to come up with solutions. The biggest impact of collaboration was highlighted by the oncogene-driven patient groups, such as the ROS1ders, ALK Positive, EGFResisters, RET Renegades, and Exon 20 mutation groups. Apart from providing support to patients and caregivers, and increasing awareness about the disease, such patient groups accelerate research by raising funds for research, helping patients enroll in oncogene-specific clinical trials, and providing tissue and biospecimens for creating new mouse models to study the unique subtype of lung cancer. As LUNGevity Scientific Advisory Board member Dr. David Carbone pointed out during his plenary talk â€œScience that matters!,â€ the first step to developing effective therapies is robust basic scienceâ€”and development of mouse models to study these unique subtypes of lung cancer is the first phase in testing new drugs.  Creation of new therapies and treatment paradigms The scientific community has also been hard at work creating new drugs for subsets of lung cancer that are hard to treat. One such subset is lung cancer that has mutations in exon 20 of the EGFR or HER2 genes. These mutations do not respond to the standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Work from Scientific Advisory Board member Dr. John Heymach shows that drugs such as poziotinib may be used for these rare subtypes of lung cancer. In addition, scientists are creating new drugs, such as entrectinib and ropotrectinib, for ROS1-positive lung cancer. These drugs are showing promise, both in patients who have been previously treated with crizotinib and those who have never received a ROS1 inhibitor. I think LUNGevity Scientific Advisory Board member Dr. Julie Brahmerâ€™s plenary presentation quote â€œNo patient is left behindâ€ is what we, as a community, should be striving for. I left this yearâ€™s World Lung feeling certain that we are taking a step in that direction. Dr. Basu Roy is LUNGevity's Director of Translational Research Programs/Director of Patient FoRCe.

Hello everyone. Hope you're having a great day. I'm a 20 year old male. I was diagnosed with MS 3 years ago. I avoided taking medications because I was afraid off side effect and my problems were minor. Each problem I had I relied on steroids. Right now I have optic neuritis. Blind spots in both of my eye. It's worst when I'm active like working out. I had it before were both of my lower eyes were blind but steroids helped. My Neru Ophthalmologist told me steroids will not help this time. I forgot why exactly. I took an MRI and exams but they couldn't find the cause. They just know it was caused by MS and it's optic neuritis. About 2 weeks ago I started on an MS medication called Gilenya. My vision still goes bad on and off. I've been worrying since it happened. Is there a chance the on and off will stop and my vision remains perfect?,gilenya,1,,,

Unfortunately she has now developed symptoms suggesting interstitial lung disease and she is now off of the Tagrisso.

"David, I do not want to try to sway you one way or the other regarding the continuance of Keytruda, but I just wanted to let you know that it is very common during the first few doses of Keytruda to see swelling and what looks like growth of the cancer. My mom is currently experiencing this, although is not having the symptoms of swelling/growth that you are. Her CT showed a ""thickening"" around the area of her tumor - on the backside of her trachea. Her pulmonologist scoped her trachea and took 5 biopsies. He reported seeing swelling and scar tissue, not much else. The biopsies all came back negative for cancer. So at this point, we are assuming a couple of things - 1) This may be just swelling due to the immune system ""attacking"" the area, 2) this could also be a mass of T-cells bunched up and ""attacking"" the tumor, 3) There may be cancer cells in the area and the biopsies did not get them. My mom has finished her 8th Keytruda treatment (6 with Keytruda + Chemo, 2 Keytruda only), the CT with the ""thickening"" was after her 6th treatment. 90% of her cells have the PD-L1 mutation.

"By Jay Hancock, Kaiser Health News Nov. 28, 2018 -- Shereese Hicksonâ€™s multiple sclerosis was flaring again. Spasms in her legs and other symptoms were getting worse. She could still walk and take care of her son six years after doctors diagnosed the disease, which attacks the central nervous system. Earlier symptoms such as slurred speech and vision problems had resolved with treatment, but others lingered: she was tired and sometimes still fell. This summer, a doctor switched her to Ocrevus, a drug approved in 2017 that delayed progression of the disease in clinical trials better than an older medicine did. Genentech, a South San Francisco-based subsidiary of Swiss pharma giant Roche, makes Ocrevus. It is one of several drugs for multiple sclerosis delivered intravenously in a hospital or clinic. Such medicines have become increasingly expensive as a group, priced in many cases at well over $80,000 a year. Hospitals delivering the drugs often take a cut by upcharging the drug or adding hefty fees for the infusion clinic. Hickson received her first two Ocrevus infusions as an outpatient two weeks apart in July and August. And then the bill came. Patient: Shereese Hickson, 39, single mother who worked as a health aide and trained as a medical coder, living in Girard, Ohio. Because her MS has left her too disabled to work, she is now on Medicare; she also has Medicaid for backup. Total Bill: $123,019 for two Ocrevus infusions taken as an outpatient. CareSource, Hicksonâ€™s Medicare managed-care plan, paid a discounted $28,960. Hickson got a bill for about $3,620, the balance calculated as her share by the hospital after the insurance reimbursement. continue reading",ocrevus,2,,,

"Hello,
 I am asking the community if anybody has this expereince with Tarceva and how to overcome this problem.
 My mother is 73 years old and was diagnosed with NSCLC (eGFR mutation). She was prescibed Tarceva 150 mg in June, 2017. She had severe rash, itching, swallowing of joints and pain but all of these went away in 3 to 4 months. But after 4/5 months of treatment, she started developing nausea and lack of appetite. I wouldn't say this really a lack of appetite since she is always hungry and wanted to eat, but she couldn't. She lost her taste in every food and her body registed any food she tried to consume including water, juices, milk. She just couldn't eat anything. Due to hunger, she became very weak. So the doctor stopped her medication for about two weeks and she started gaining back the ability to eat. Then she was put on 100 mg - after only taking it for 4/5 days, she developed the same symptoms. So, the doctor suggested not to take Tarceva for about a month. Also she was on antibiotic for 14 days for her H. Pylori. During this time, she regained the ability to eat and started enjoying food that she couldn't eat for months. Anyway, the doctor further reduced the drug to 50 mg/Day. She started taking this about 6 days ago and I am seeing the same symptoms - cannot take any food. The sight of food makes her nauseated and she just cannot eat. We tried several nausea medicine - none of them really helped.
 Anybody had this kind of problem with Tarceva? Any way out of it? I am feeling like if she does not die from Cancer, she'll die from hunger. I am so confused, not sure what to do. Please let me know if anybody has this kind of expereince with Tarceva.",tarceva,1,,,

"Mari, If we were to take a moment and analyze the worste case scenario, it is MS - it's not a tumor or a stroke. That's not good news, but it's less bad. Also, if you consider your ""nervous breakdown"" to have been your first exacerbation (you should trust your own judgement on this), then you have a slow moving disease course that you found early enough to respond to correctly. Now, what to do? First breathe. Pamper yourself in some small way. I can't live the one-day-at-a-time philosophy (to obsessive), but I can make today good. You can, too. You've got some time until your next appointment, so pass it with taking opportunities to do nice things for yourself. Then, if and when it becomes official, recognize that MS has picked a fight, but has not won yet. Pick up something and start swinging! OMS is perfect, and often times enough. But, you may want to explore the many pharmaceutical options people didn't have 20 years ago. I found Aubagio agreeable, but am now in the middle of HSCT (see my thread on this). If I weren't doing that, I would use Ocrelizumab. There are options. Keep your head up and fight like a mofo! Faith and optimism create a physiological feedback loop that heals. Good luck.

"ikhlaq1, Yes, alectinib has proven to be effective in the brain for many people in whom alectinib is effective in the rest of the body.  Since leptomeningeal disease (lepto, cancer in the lining of the brain) is so difficult to treat alectinib would be a leading choice of treatment.  Since this is a new treatment many oncologist still want to use radiation for areas that are causing symptoms.  If your brother has symptoms from the brain met outside the lining stereotactic radiation may still be an option then move on to alectinib.  Again, being a new drug without much research directed at lepto in ALK + patients his oncologist may not have that info and may need to be introduced to the idea.

"Hello So many times Iâ€™ve started to post here, but havenâ€™t been sure what to ask until today.  Hereâ€™s the full story. Upon my fatherâ€™s diagnosis of NSCLC with rib, hip, back, brain, liver and kidney metastasis (06/05/16) he began his chemo treatment with radiation on his brain and rib.  At first he was very responsive.  Within two months of chemo, he was almost back to his normal self.  Heâ€™d put on weight, was off the oxygen and was even back to volunteering at the Air Force base. We were so full of hope. Then, the chemo stopped working. The oncologist put him on Immunotherapy (Tecentriq).  As soon as he started the treatment, he lost his appetite/weight, became very weak and slept a lot.  These all seemed like side effects of the treatment.  However, 10 days ago, a new scan confirmed that the treatment wasnâ€™t working and that the tumors were growing and multiplying.  His oncologist said that the next course of treatment would be to radiate the 2 new tumors on his brain, and then start a new chemo/immuno combo treatment. Unfortunately, 4 days later the home nurse worried that he had contracted pneumonia and called the paramedics to take him to the hospital.  While in the hospital, the doctor said he wasnâ€™t kicking pneumonia, increasing became weaker (couldnâ€™t sit up or get out of bed) and was in a LOT of pain.  The doctor said he probably only had a couple of months and recommended Hospice.  We contacted his oncologist who confirmed that Hospice in-patient was the best course of action.  Trusting they knew best, we decided today to make the move, with the hope that they would take the best care and get him home WE were all let down by Hospice and feel that we made the wrong choice.  How do we know if we are giving up or doing whatâ€™s right?  I live in Amsterdam but will stay with my mom in Dayton, OH to care for my father if we thought it was the best, but I donâ€™t know if we can provide for him enough.  He needs full time care.

"For the first time since diagnosis, I am being included in pharmaceutical informational events. Initially I was rather apprehensive, but found it silly not to attend one very close i proximity to me. Not only did I glean a good bit of information from the presentation, I also made some important MS Warrior contacts. This evening I plan to travel to Morgantown in order to hear about the positive effects of LEMTRADA, an MS infusion unfamiliar to me. I never considered an infusion as part of my disease treatment until a friend told me about another, newer drug that he read about in a major news paper. So, if an Ocrevus event pops up somewhere close, I will consider attending that lecture as well. During my most recent doctor visit, it was explained to me that of the three medical treatment for multiple sclerosis, infusion was the highest on the list at this time. That makes sense, but evidently is the most expensive and time-invasive method (It requires an entire day to complete an infusion, but at least it only happens once or twice a year.) Injections are least effective, the new and exciting oral drugs are second, but infusion is supposedly ""the bomb"". So, my original drug of choice (Beta Seron) is practically a dinosaur in the world of MS combatants. I actually find that rather exciting because that means that MS research and medical investigation is definitely progressing. Options are being explored on a daily basis, giving hope to Mystery Solved sooner than later occurring. To make this work, though, drug companies need our help in weeding out the best and worst. Yes, comrades, that means we are the human guinea pigs agreeing go trials and testing that will result in a final result some where along the way. I am usually fairly game to jump in there and experiment. At this point I really do not have anything to lose. But, my end goal is to be around for as long as possible. My son will be a senior in high school next year. We have college to attend, a career to explore, a driver's license (He's not interested!) to acquire. Because he pretty much saved my life at the beginning of this horrible medical journey, I owe it him to do my best to hang around for as long as possible. These Big Pharm events help me to do so. The more I learn, the better my life decisions can be. Even though I really do NOT relish the idea of infusion treatment, I DO need to learn more about it. It is my...our...job as MS advocates to  learn more. It is so easy to get all excited about this learning process. It is equally disturbing to learn the realities of said quest. Not trying to be a sad sack, I need to share the  warning label for the drug I will hear about tonight. They have them, the  warnings. But we are Warriors, Super Heroes. And Super Heroes  "" boldly go where no man has gone before ."" Don't allow the following words to frighten you. Shake it off and dive into your own research.  Serious infusion reactions: LEMTRADA can cause serious infusion reactions that may cause death. Serious infusion reactions may happen while you receive, or up to 24 hours or longer after you receive LEMTRADA. You will receive your infusion at a healthcare facility with equipment and staff trained to manage infusion reactions, including serious allergic reactions, and urgent heart or breathing problems. You will be watched while you receive, and for 2 hours or longer after you receive, LEMTRADA. If a serious infusion reaction happens while you are receiving LEMTRADA, your infusion may be stopped. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of a serious infusion reaction during the infusion, and after you have left the healthcare facility:  swelling in your mouth or throat trouble breathing weakness fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat chest pain rash To lower your chances of getting a serious infusion reaction, your healthcare provider will give you a medicine called corticosteroids before your first 3 infusions of a treatment course. You may also be given other medicines before or after the infusion to try to reduce your chances of having these reactions or to treat them after they happen.  Certain cancers: Receiving LEMTRADA may increase your chance of getting some kinds of cancers, including thyroid cancer, skin cancer (melanoma), and blood cancers called lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphoma. Call your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms that may be a sign of thyroid cancer:",ocrevus,2,,,

"Hello, My father has been suffering from Stg 4 NSCLC (Triple Negative, PDL-1 +ve at 30%) from last 4+ months. He is 73 yrs old. Since his performance score was > 2 doctors advised against chemo (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel) and he has been on Keytruda immunotherapy for 3 cycles now. It has helped reduce his pleural effusion , reduced tumors, increased appetite and pain significantly. However, a week ago doctors found new lesions on C4 and C5 cervical vertebrae. Now the doctor says that this being â€œdisease progression â€œ, Keytruda needs to be immediately stopped and he needs to be put on Paclitaxel (if his PS<2) or given Tarceva (just due to lack of other options). Has anyone else been in the same boat ? I'm very confused as he has had a lot of positive effects after we have started Keytruda and just the cervical lesions being new are going to make him devoid of any treatment options whatsoever. Can we not continue Keytruda for a couple of more cycles and do a scan again ? He is already having palliative radiation for the cervical lesions FYI.

"Hi Sameen, Welcome to GRACE. I am sorry to hear of the progression of your motherâ€™s cancer through more than one line of therapy. Tagrisso is known to be effective against lung cancer which has the T790M mutation, but its efficacy is not clear against non-T790M positive disease. Itâ€™s not that it isnâ€™t safe to try it; it certainly can be a more easily tolerated therapy than chemotherapy, itâ€™s really just a question of whether it will help her. If a follow-up scan shows significant progression, then typically her options would be for chemotherapy, since sheâ€™s already tried immunotherapy and targeted therapy. If she doesnâ€™t want to try another chemotherapy option, or if she continues to weaken to the point where her doctor doesnâ€™t feel that it is something she can tolerate, then unfortunately you will want to look to palliative therapy to keep her as comfortable as possible. There are times when patients improve as a result of palliative therapy, but in general itâ€™s just a good choice to make a patient as comfortable as possible.

"As reported at the current International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer ( Abstract PL02.01 ) and in The New England Journal of Medicine by Antonia et al, the phase III PACIFIC trial has shown significantly improved overall survivalâ€”a co-primary endpointâ€”with durvalumab (Imfinzi) vs placebo after chemoradiotherapy in unresectable stage III nonâ€“small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An earlier report from the trial supported the approval of durvalumab in this setting in February 2018 on the basis of improved progression-free survival. Study Details In the international double-blind trial, 709 patients were randomized 2:1 between May 2014 and April 2016 to receive durvalumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) (n = 473) or IV placebo every 2 weeks (n = 236) for up to 12 months as consolidation in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC without progression after â‰¥ 2 cycles of definitive platinum-based chemoradiation. Randomization was performed at 1 to 42 days after receipt of chemoradiotherapy and was stratified according to age, sex, and smoking history. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival assessed by blinded independent central review and overall survival. Overall Survival As of data cutoff in March 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 25.2 months. Overall survival at 24 months was 66.3% in the durvalumab group vs 55.6% in the placebo group ( P = .005). Median overall survival was not reached (95% confidence interval [CI] = 34.7 monthsâ€“not reached) vs 28.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.9 monthsâ€“not reached). The stratified hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival for durvalumab vs placebo was 0.68 ( P = .0025). The overall survival benefit with durvalumab was observed across all prespecified subgroups. Updated analysis showed median progression-free survival of 17.2 vs 5.6 months (stratified HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.41â€“0.63). After discontinuation of study treatment, 41.0% of the durvalumab group and 54.0% of the placebo group received additional anticancer therapy. Median time to death or distant metastasis was 28.3 months in the durvalumab group vs 16.2 months in the placebo group (stratified HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.41â€“0.68). New brain metastases were found in 6.3% vs 11.8% of patients. Investigator-assessed median time to second progression or death was 28.3 months vs 17.1 months (stratified HR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.46â€“0.73). Safety Profile Safety profiles were similar to those previously reported. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 30.5% of the durvalumab group vs 26.1% of the placebo group. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 15.4% vs 9.8% of patients, with the most common cause being pneumonitis in both groups (4.8% vs 2.6%). Adverse events of special interest occurred in 66.7% vs 49.1% (grade 1 or 2 in 56.8% vs 43.6%). Serious adverse events occurred in 29.1% vs 23.1% of patients, and adverse events led to death in 4.4% vs 6.4%. The investigators concluded, â€œ[This] trial showed a survival advantage with durvalumab therapy after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLCâ€¦.

"We thank Drs. Bhatia and Puri for the comment on our article. [1] The randomized clinical trial (RCT) remains the design of reference to evaluate theoretical effect of treatments. When the sample size is sufficient, a RCT ensures comparability of both treated and control groups. An additional advantage is marginal causality estimation (i.e. treatment effect of an entire treated population vs an entire control population). Nevertheless, it is well established that RCTs are performed during optimal circumstances (over-representation of treatment-adherent patients, low frequency of morbidity, etc.), resulting in non-representative conclusions for real-life practices. [2] Observational studies can closely represent real-life treatment effect, but treated and control patients are often non-comparable due to lack of randomization. We compared fingolimod- vs natalizumab-treated patients with clinical and radiological outcomes at 1 and 2 years. [1] No other study has compared such outcomes in these patients, making the work original and strengthening the perceived impression of natalizumab's clinical superiority (at least for patients with the most aggressive disease). We agree safety and compliance data would have strengthened our research, but such data were unavailable. As we concluded in our article, [1] a RCT is needed to objectively compare natalizumab and fingolimod. 1. Barbin L, Rousseau C, Jousset N, et al.

"@avengr13 I think I addressed an earlier post of yoursâ€¦.. maybe not. We have so much in common except I have spent the last 3 years reading everything available, applied for a clinical trial, fostered relationships with others in the clinical trial here in the States(FL). I just missed out on the last trial and have been fighting MS for decades even though just DXâ€™d â€™05 RRMS which is key to qualifying for Lem in the States. Depending on the insurance carrier, you either must be RRMS or a relapsing form of MS. Payers are becoming very biased against us â€œolderâ€ patients. They want us all to be deemed progressive so that they can decline their coverage of a DMD. I donâ€™t think Tysabri should be in the same discussion as Lem. I have taken both drugs. Lem only required 8 infusions in the first 12 months for most participants in the 5 year clinical trial. It â€œresetsâ€ the immune system the first 30 days so MS traits are â€œunlearnedâ€. Tysabri suppresses the immune system, no reset, and carries the risk of PML. Lem HALTED or REVERSED the progression of MS for most participants in the trial with NO risk of PML. Tysabri requires continuous monthly infusions forever.that can slow the progression of MS. SEs are serious for each drug; however, the most common ones with Lem are Thyroid related which are easily detected and managed using monthly blood tests (paid for in full by Genzyme), and common RX drugs. Lem research is being done right now using APPROVED drugs to take AFTER Lem to diminish the chance for SEs. Ocrelizumab is still YEARS away from approval. My best friend was WC bound with most of the horrible disabilities I am fighting. By tht third year post Lem, she was walking 4 miles/day and felt very well.

"We talked to the oncologist about my husband's PET scan from last week! He has been on Keytruda since mid-November and also got one low-dose Yervoy three weeks ago (next one is tomorrow). Mixed results: - Most mets have shrunk (in fact, the one near his spine that put my husband in a wheelchair and in the hospital last November has disappeared) - There is one small, new spot elsewhere in his spine - The spot in his adrenal gland looks brighter on the scan - His liver looks a little worse in his blood work So ... Mixed bag. The oncologist thinks that the new spot in his spine as well as the brighter spot in his adrenal gland could be due to the introduction of Yervoy, since that might have led to additional inflammation. She says it's hard to tell from the scan. The liver issues might also be from the Yervoy. He will go back for blood work again in a week and a half to monitor his liver more closely. He will also get another PET scan in three months (barring worsening symptoms in the meantime) to get a clearer idea of whether these drugs are really working for him or not.

"I'm sorry, but I continue to not understand how the Ocrelizumab trials have changed the dogma regarding PPMS, other than reinforcing what we already knew from the nearly decade-old Rituxan PPMS trials. While it is encouraging that there appears to be a subgroup of PPMS patients on whom these anti-CD20 drugs will be moderately effective (namely, younger, less disabled, and with enhancing lesions), this population represents only about 15% of the greater PPMS population. The other 85% don't appear to be very likely to see benefit from this drug it all. The Ocrelizumab trials were clearly frontloaded with patients who were likely to be responders, based on the information gleaned from the previous Rituxan trials. Strangely, the trial was statistically underpowered to prove or disprove efficacy in patients without enhancing lesions. I hate to read nefarious intent where there may have been none, but this seems like a gross oversight, and more likely a conscious decision on the part of the drug manufacturer to muddy the waters when it comes to getting the drug approved. I've not seen any reason to believe that Ocrelizumab will be any more or less effective than Rituxamab in treating PPMS, and Rituxamab would appear to have a much friendlier safety profile. It's clear that the only reason Ocrelizumab was developed was because Rituxamab was due to soon come off patent, a decision which very nearly blew up in the drug company's face when Ocrelizumab's lupus and Crohn's trials were halted because of patient deaths. The MS trials proved to be a saving grace, but only because it was deemed that MS patients have a higher tolerance of risk due to the morbid nature of the disease. My neurologist and the others in his practice routinely use Rituxamab to treat PPMS patients, with a rate of success of just about what you would expect given the statistics that have been accrued in both anti-CD20 PPMS drug trials. These doctors seem quite disgruntled with the fact that Ocrelizumab is seeing so much hype, when Rituxan is already available (albeit, off label) and may be a safer agent. Granted, any progress in the battle against PPMS is to be heralded, but Ocrelizumab appears, to me at least, to be shrouded in all sorts of reasons for concern, from its very reason for being developed to a potentially frightening side effect profile to what appears to be cleverly manipulated trial data on its effectiveness. As a person with likely PPMS myself, I yearn for the day when real reason for hope is provided to us by the drug companies and/or other researchers. At best, Ocrelizumab seems a small incremental step, and one that merely replicates the efficacy of an already existing drug. Honestly, sorry if I'm coming off as overly cynical and critical of the work Dr. G has put in on Ocrelizumab. It seems so much of the other research this group is involved in is truly cutting-edge and ""outside the box"", that banging the Ocrelizumab drum is a detour from discovering that long sought after Black Swan which will forever alter the MS treatment paradigmâ€¦",ocrelizumab,1,,,
"A few months back I asked my neuro about Shingrix. She didn't get an answer but here is what the NMSS says. The CDC recommends Shingrix, a non-live vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and related complications. The vaccine, which is given in two doses separated by 2 to 6 months, is recommended over ZostavaxÂ® (the previously approved vaccine for shingles). Shingrix is approved for adults 50 years and older: whether or not they have had a prior episode of herpes zoster or have had a dose of Zostavax who have a chronic medical condition, unless there is a specific reason why the individual should not have it who are getting other adult vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines No studies of Shingrix have been done in people with MS. However, in two clinical studies with Shingrix, there was no increase in immune-mediated conditions. The CDC indicates that a person who is taking a low-dose immunosuppressive therapy or is going to begin taking an immunosuppressive medication can take Shingrix.

"Hello That sounds like a pretty unhelpful way to be given a diagnosis of MS. Were you given any pointers by the neurologist as to which drugs he thought you should be considering? Apart from ignore the injectables? And the contact details of an MS nurse so you can run through the options with someone knowledgeable? The incredible thoughtlessness of doctors makes me want to shout and swear at them. Of course you are overwhelmed. It may be that you were expecting the diagnosis, but even so, it still hits you like a hammer to the forehead. I would anticipate your emotions to be a bit all over the place over the next days/weeks/months (maybe longer). Donâ€™t feel constrained to â€˜see the positivesâ€™, or â€˜acceptâ€™ it. MS is crap. And the best you can do (imo) is to fight it with a big stick (ie a strong disease modifying drug). In terms of disease modifying drugs (DMDs), these can all have side effects to balance against their benefits. The point of a DMD is to reduce the number and severity of relapses. And the DMDs vary widely in their efficacy. But to balance their effectiveness comes potential side effects. The first DMDs on the market were the initial 4 injectables, the beta-interferons and Copaxone. These have now been joined by variants of the types of interferon and Copaxone. Essentially though, they come with milder side effects and an average relapse reduction rate of about 30%. Added to this group is Aubagio, a once a day pill. In my opinion, I should give Aubagio a body swerve, itâ€™s still got a relapse reduction rate of about 30%, but comes with a long list of possible side effects. These drugs are all category 1.1, or Mildly Effective. And they are what youâ€™ve been told to ignore as options. The next group is category 1.2, or More Effective: Gilenya, Cladribine and Tecfidera. They are all tablets, all have a relapse reduction rate of about 50%. They all have the possibility of side effects, some more serious than others, but the side effects seem to be all resolvable once the drug is stopped. Gilenya and Tecfidera are daily pills, while Cladribine (aka Mavenclad) is taken over 2 years for 2 periods of time each year. I would expect that Cladribine and Tecfidera are the best options from this group. The last, category 2 is Very Effective: Lemtrada, Ocrevus and Tysabri. These are all infusions, and all have an average relapse reduction rate of about 70%, but significantly worse potential side effects. Lemtrada is taken 2 years running but has some risks attached including developing Autoimmune Thyroid Disease. Tysabri is a once a month infusion and also has risks, in particular a rare brain virus called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopthy (PML), But you can only develop this is you have the antibodies for a virus called John Cunningham Virus (or are JCV positive). The risk of this is quite well managed with regular blood tests, but it is a real consideration. The newest of this category is Ocrevus, itâ€™s taken every 6 months by IV infusion but significantly has much less serious potential side effects. This would probably be the safest and best option out of this group. Have a look at https://www.mstrust.org.uk/about-ms/ms-treatments/ms-decisions-aid This decision aid goes into a lot more detail about the various drugs, their benefits, means of taking them and possible side effects. If you have been given the contact details of an MS nurse, Iâ€™d talk it through with him/her as well as with your family and/or friends as any decision you make is likely to also affect your close family. If youâ€™ve not been given access to an MS nurse, try phoning your neurologists secretary and ask how you get in touch with a nurse. Talking all the options through with someone who understands what theyâ€™re all about is fairly essential. I used to think it was a pretty bad show in the bad old days when I was given four videos of the four injectables that were then available (films made by the drug companies!) and told â€˜watch these and pick oneâ€™. Times have improved in terms of the number of drugs available, but not in interpersonal terms, if youâ€™ve been just told: â€˜here they are, avoid those, but pick one of the othersâ€™! I wish you the best of luck with your choice of drugs. If you chose a lower risk category 1.2 drug, you would of course still have the potential to move to one of the more effective category 2 drugs. But many people, faced with â€˜very active MSâ€™ head straight for the most effective drug they can get hold of to hopefully avoid potential disability in the future. For my part, Iâ€™ve been unlucky with DMDs. I had side effects with 3 out of 4 drugs that Iâ€™ve tried and Copaxone stopped working. Iâ€™ve had MS now for 22 years, have just started relapsing again after a few years when relapses stopped and am going to give Copaxone another whirl, simply because thatâ€™s my only option. Because Iâ€™ve spent nearly all my years DMD free, Iâ€™m quite badly disabled. This is the reason I would definitely start a decent DMD as soon as you can (very few people have such a bad experience with as many drugs as I have). Sue",ocrevus,0,,,
"Love your articles as always. As a person living with MS for 18 years, diagnosed 15 years, I know my share of disease modifying therapies (even have participated in a few clinical trials).

"My headaches are mild, but I started having more problems with my vision. Sometimes it is difficult to read and focus my eyes in one tarcet. I still use pazopanib 400 mg per day, because when I stop it completely headaches turn way worse. It is very likely that 2 biggest tumors start growing again sooner or later, so we need a plan for that. It is possible that radiation, pazopanib,  keytruda compination could kill tumors over 2 cm, but I cant count on it. I see no medical reason why surgery wouldnt be possible and effective for the 2 biggest tumors. As long as the only reason not to operate is that there is 20 tumors, I think we continue to try to find somepody willing to operate, when biggest tumors start growing again. Waiting until tumors cause emergency, would give me poor change to survive. Of course if new tumors appear it will change everything, but so far that hasnt happened. I need to talk to neurosurgeon again, because most likely I am missing something. Last time I had very short interaction with a surgeon. I am ok with the possibity of dieing during surgery. Yes i Know that statistically we have good heatcare, but because I have disease that is so rare that doctors dont have to know anything about it, it is hard to not feel disappointed.

The waters in the case of the other two drugs are loosely bound because both drugs make noncovalent interactions and hence trap waters under only one constraint - that of the compaction arising from the exon 19 deletion.

This was back in July 2013. Was on for about 14 months and had a mixed response.  Attempted to get on the Aura trial back in Nov. 2014.  She was rejected because she had previously received a kidney transplant and was on certain anti-rejection/immunosuppressants meds.   They did three rounds of carboplatin/pemetrexed and then maintenance pemetrexed ever few weeks until about three or four months ago since she was in the hospital 3 times with pneumonia.  They stopped, not because the pemetrexed stopped working but due to the complicationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.cancer progressed and tube inserted to assist with fluidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦seems to have helped. Dr. sent pleural fluid for biopsy as she obtained a compassionate use application approved for osimertinib, not yet approved in Canada as far as I know, but the results came back that she was negative for the T790 mutation.  This was yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s news.  Dr., also indicate that biopsy seemed to show even less pronouncement of prior EGFR mutations. Sorry for the long winded start, but my MIL is on various anti-rejection/immunosuppressants meds because she had a kidney transplant in November 2007. Sounds like without being positive for the T790 mutation, the options for her are limited.  Dr. plans to try three rounds of pemetrexed on its own and see what the response is. The next option after that was taxotere? Dr. said this is much stronger and could have more side effects.

"Hi There, This is certainly the place to get it all out there - we've all been there or are there, and SCLC truly is one of the worst. There's nothing wrong with feeling however you feel and certainly nothing offensive about voicing that here. However, I do want to correct something regarding Tecentriq and clinical trial data in general. Oftentimes, you'll read the study reports or headlines of what seems to be a big deal, but you don't get why people are so excited. So, this study touted as a major breakthrough reported a 2-month improvement in PFS, OS or whatever. Those are baseline statistics for how reports across all kinds of diseases and medications. However, what that practically means is not that it prolongs some peoples' lives by 2 months. Rather, it means that for most people it doesn't work at all, but for a sub-population of SCLC patients, it prolonged there life very significantly (in many cases even longer than the time period of the study). That's how immunotherapy seems to work - it produces durable responses in a distinct population of people (but usually eventually stops working), but it doesn't help for most people. So, if your husband's tumor has the right genetic profile, than there is a chance it may very well be a life-saver for him. But, as with much with these new treatments and this terrible disease, so much is uncertain...some people who don't have the right signs in their genetic tests, and it somehow works, and some people who have all the right signs aren't helped. It's a crap shoot. Best of luck in everything!",tecentriq,0,,,

"Hi SharonK, I am so thankful your son is recovering at this time! If you don't mind, I will express my opinion about treatment options. First, I would not choose Gilyena because it is not nearly as effective as Tysabri or Ocrevus. Also, the cases of PML reported in Europe with Gilyena is vastly greater than the number of cases reported in the USA. So that gives me pause, also. BTW, the cases of PML on Tecfidera reported in Europe are much greater than in the USA, also. The biggest favor you can do for your son is educate yourself using this research site: http://multiple-sclerosis-research.b...ternative.html Second, I would seriously consider waiting for Ocrevus because if you begin Tysabri it can be difficult to get off. The reason is because MS often rebounds with a vengeance when coming off that drug. What Tysabri does is keep certain destructive cells from entering the CNS. Those cells are still circulating in the blood stream. When Tysabri is removed then those cells can rush in and cause major flare-up in MS. The protocol for switching from Tysabri to Ocrevus is a guessing game right now. For most people it will go just fine, I believe. But for many, it will not be pleasant at all. That is why I would give serious thought to waiting for Ocrevus. There is no other MS drug I would even consider other than Tysabri or Ocrevus because they poorly effective and/or have awful side effects or a combination of both, JMHO. The only other option I might consider with a 20 year old son would be stem cell transplant but only at a legitimate, well respected, institution. PS... I have spent years studying MS and treatments on behalf on my wife with MS. She was one of the first patients receiving Tysabri (early 2002 in trials) and continues doing extremely well on it today. She is JC virus positive and is considering Ocrevus. Best wishes, Sharon. Your son is fortunate to have you. Please do consider Ocrevus. It is virtually as effective as Tysabri but without the PML risk. True, there is very little risk with Tysabri in the first two years of treatment. But it is a little like riding a tiger... you are safe as long as you stay on... but getting off safely is quite tricky. There are no other drugs I would even come close to considering as effective in treating MS. But that is JMHO, please understand that. Some people develop neutralizing antibodies to a particular drug and may have limited options and in those cases, or for other reasons, one of the approved drugs may be okay.",ocrevus,1,,,

"Hello all, I am new here and came across this place looking for advice on my new treatment. I was diagnosed in 2010 with RRMS. I have been doing ok on Rebif all this time but recently had a MRI and have an active lesion. I have also suffered from dizzy spells, weakness in left hand and worst of all terrible fatigue, memory loss and difficulty with concentration. Its got to the point where people at work who dont know I have MS are saying I look like someone has taken out my battery. I try hard not to let people notice but its getting harder. I have also had a few other random symptoms but find it hard to say if its normal or the MS causing it. Anyway I went to the hospital today to have my meds looked at due to the MRI results. The advice from the neurolagist was to go on Mavenclad or Gilenya. I have read everything I could find on both and also looked both up on here but I am not sure which to choose. I like the idea that Maveclad is a 2 year treatment over a total of 5 days each year. I know I will still need to be monitored but it just seems ideal. Something they said bothers me which is why I am not sure. They said Gilenya is tablets daily but it means if I stop the effect just wears off but Mavenclad is not reversable. Not sure this is a problem but just seems so final. Also they say no treatment is needed in year 3 & 4. What happens after that in year 5â€¦.. Nothing is mentioned anywhere if you just do the course again or are they expecting the MS to stay in remission? I think these are things I need to email my MS nurse about. She did say what they would yreat me wirh if the Mevenclad would not work where as with Gilenya there are a couple of alternatives. The side effects of th Gilenya seem a but worse too which is why I am drawn to the Mavenclad. Just really hard making this decision. I know none of you can tell me what to choose but it helps knowing there might be others in my shoes and at least you all understand what Im dealing with.

The app, available in the iTunes and Google app stores, can be used with or without VR goggles and works in two modes. In story mode, viewers look around a doctors office in full 360 degrees and see three patients waiting. Choosing any patient will open up that persons story along with a video from their life, like a birthday party or picnic, shown through their specific retinal eye disease view. The three diseases featured are neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD; diabetic macular edema, or DME; and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, or MEfRVO. The second view is live mode, which engages the phones camera to allow viewers to see whatever is in their field of vision through the three different retinal conditions.

However, as work began, the idea grew to broaden the app for use by caregivers, family, friends and anyone who does not have a retinal disease. Its very easy to talk about retinal disease from a clinical perspective in terms of letters on a chart or numbers gained, but the challenge is what its like to have that day-to-day experience of retinal disease, Natalie Mancuso, senior product manager of marketing in ophthalmology at Regeneron, said in an interview. Really immersing someone into this experience creates empathy. We wanted to make sure that we were getting folks engaged in order to drive action and education. Brent Scholz, vice president and executive creative director at Intouch, also noted the importance of empathy and called the app a bridge to understanding. When patients first encounter vision problems and go to the doctor, they are gripped with worries and thoughts about things like not being able to drive and losing their independence, Scholz said. Its a pretty emotional thing for them, and doctors are great dealing with the facts, but as patients have told us, they tend to talk more clinically, and dont always seem to fully understand whatthe patients are feeling about whats at stake.

"Hi Adam, Happy New Year! I have been diagnosed with UC 15 months ago. Iâ€™m still struggling with the disease, and canâ€™t say I have been in remission yet. Since you have been longer dealing with this, just would like to ask you about sun. Although I have been living in the U.S. for 20 years, Iâ€™m originally from South America. No history in the family (big by both sides) of this disease. Indeed, the first time I heard about it was when I was diagnosed with it. So, Iâ€™m still very illiterate about the topic. However, one issue I always heard and was told about is to run from the sun. In other words, sun is over for people with this disease or any auto-immune disease. Because it is an auto-immune disease, it can trigger skin cancer even when you are in remission or not taking medications that may cause skin cancer (as it is my case right now with remicade and imuran). Any feedback you can provide about that? Being from South America and being raised in the sun (of course, I was never the crazy one being the whole day under the sun without protection), this has been devastating to me.

"Today is the day I start Gilenya. I am sure all of you know how it feels â€” another day, another medication, that is what life with multiple sclerosis (MS) is like. In 2008 I took part in the phase three clinical trial for Gilenya, which still went by the name fingolimod at that time. I only was in the trial for a couple of weeks because my liver reacted. To be fair, I had taken a lot of Tylenol the day before the blood test and I later found out I had been assigned the higher dose of the med during the trial. Still, my doctors have been standoffish with placing me back onto this med since it hit the market. But recently, like many with MS, I have been funneled through a few other meds and was  tired of their side effects , so I finally decided it was worth the risk.  Trial and Error Shopping for the right med is one of those things I really never expected to do when I was diagnosed with this disease. I had always figured my doctors would have a set protocol of drugs and treatments, but MS has taught me that reality is a bit different than that. The truth is that everyone is different. We all respond to the different medications in our own way. It isnâ€™t as easy of a decision as only figuring out which medication has proven to be the most effective. We must also consider which has the most tolerable amount or types of side effects for our bodies. The first medicine I tried was Rebif. It, for me, was fairly tolerable. I was able to take my medicine on time, every time, and I would take some ibuprofen and go to sleep early on the dosage evenings. Five years passed and I became tired of sleeping through three evenings a week. I became tired of having the flu every Monday, Wednesday and Friday night. Mostly I became tired of being tired and began realizing most of the years of my sonâ€™s life were filled with this tired version of me. Countless bedtime stories and goodnight kisses went missed. I was sad and it was time for a change. Almost two years ago I began Tecfidera. Again, the drug did what it was supposed to do. I took my medication religiously and it rewarded me with preventing any new lesions to my brain and spine. This medicine was different; I no longer had injections or the fatigue and flu three nights a week. In that way, Tecfidera felt like a cold glass of water. On the other hand, there were the side effects. My experience with this med was severe stomach pains and turning red multiple times a day.

MS and Walking Again Dealing With Side Effects I was told the side effects would lessen over time, but they didnâ€™t. I was told eating proteins and fats when I took the pills would help, and it did. The problem, for me, was that my life became a balancing act of eating the right foods in order to get past the side effects. Two years of my life yielded about 20 pounds of weight gain without a valid way to lose the pounds. I became depressed and felt overrun and worn down. I needed to be free of these terrible side effects. It is amazing what daily stomach aches and burning skin sensations can do to your mind after the days pile up. Next page: more of Libbyâ€™s experience with trying new meds.  Dealing With Side Effects Eating past the meds was not working as well as it used to, so I began to feel a tunnel vision view of my life and happiness encroaching. For the first time in many years, I felt terrified. My big decision to quit came about a month ago when I had been doing some shopping at the mall with my husband and son. I had done everything right; I had eaten a hearty breakfast that was low in carbs, but it was one of those days when eating right wasnâ€™t enough. My husband looked at me â€” I knew that look so well â€” and said, â€œHoney, we need to get you something to eat. Youâ€™re turning red.â€ â€œNot again, not again,â€ I thought, but I knew it was true. The burning began to drip its way down my scalp and people had already begun to stare. We rushed to the healthiest thing we could find and picked up some crÃªpes. I had accidentally chosen the wrong kind; I wanted a Caprese crÃªpe, but the one I actually chose was covered in canned mushrooms, which are the absolute worst. In the meantime, I looked like an Oompa Loompa. I was so flushed I was almost purple. I was faced with continuing with this reaction or shoving more terrible food down my throat. I sat at the table frozen, on the verge of tears. My husband was getting worried and tried to get me to talk. My head was reeling. I had told every doctor I had seen in the past two years about these side effects. Oftentimes, I would turn red in their offices, right before their eyes. I had been searching for help and none of them seemed at all concerned. They had all fluffed it off like it was just a small tradeoff for not losing my ability to walk and see. How could I argue with their logic? Still, here I was â€” empty and shredded yet again. I had no words left and my husband wanted so desperately for me to speak. My body was burning up. I was tired of eating all the time, which was often stuff like what was on the table in front of me. For a second I even thought, â€œMaybe my body is not meant to live in this world. Maybe I am just  not supposed to live .â€ That thought terrified me.  Getting out of the Dark I have never wanted to give up. Something was awfully, terribly, horribly wrong. As I looked from one set of worried eyes to the other, I realized my husband and son were seeing it too.

Books Every MSer Should Read The time had come and I finally said, â€œI need to quit Tecfidera.â€ Now that I have dropped the Tecfidera, I can see how easy it was to step away and try something new. But when I was in the thick of it, that wasnâ€™t how I felt at all. To me, I was running short on options. To me, the idea of trying Gilenya was, because of my clinical trial results, risky. Honestly, it still might be. Looking at it now though, I realize things for me had gotten pretty dark. I am not a dark person by nature, so things had to have been really piling up for me to have been feeling as trapped as I had felt. I am writing this today as a reminder to all of you and to myself to not allow things to get so dark before you turn around and start walking towards the light again. I pride myself in being a person that never gives up, a person that never quits. Sometimes though, quitting one thing is the only way to continue another. In this case, the med I chose had come to run my life off the rails. My life is more important than that med. My life is worth the risk of trying something scary and new.",gilenya,2,,,
"Aw Lorraine That's crap. What a shame you've had to stop Tysabri. I'm not in exactly the same position as you, but not currently on a DMD either. Tysabri gave me raised liver enzymes so I had to stop taking it. Then Tecfidera (which I presume is the other drug you can't take because of your JCV status) gave me depleted lymphocytes so I had to stop that too. I've already had bad side effects from Avonex and failed on copaxone (ie started relapsing again). Given my history, and the fact that I'm now very disabled and have had MS for 19 years, I don't think another DMD is a possibility for me, but you are in a different position I'm sure. You should get on another DMD even one that's got a worse relapse reduction rate, like a beta interferon or copaxone. Have you already tried them? What about Gilenya? Is that a possibility? Or one of the super drugs if you can bear the risk (Lemtrada, HSCT or Cladribine. Have you got an MS nurse? If so, get onto her/him and see what's available to you. Otherwise, have you an appointment set to see your neurologist? If not, get on to his/her secretary and get one sorted out. You shouldn't be left adrift with no raft at all, even if it's something that isn't as good as Tysabri is better than nothing. Hopefully you'll be able to get something sorted out.

"GrouseMan wrote: The dosing schedule sounds similar to what my wife's current trial is attempting to do with Irinotecan, Erbitux, with or without Avastin (or placebo). They dropped the 5-FU from the previous FOLFIRI and added Erbitux. She thinks she is still getting the Avastin based on previous experience with it (She is still on the ACE inhibitor they use with Avastin use though her BP is usually low to begin with). She has only the infusion on Mondays, then nothing again until day 14 when she gets hit again. Problem is I don't know if they are using a higher dosage of Erbitux or not. She is tolerating this very well and the rash came on after a week, not right away, but she thinks it was subsiding prior to yesterdays infusion (which was #2). I am of course interested in the UCSD trial as I contributed research to these class of drugs - particularly CI-1033, and Dacomitinib. I still believe despite the failure of Dacomitinib against Erlotinib in the big Pfizer NSCLC trial (ARCHER 1009) that Dacomitinib is still a superior EGFR family inhibitor. The UCSD trial looks promising. We know that EGFr inhibitors once they become resistant, that if one lays off them for a while the pathway that was diverted and make the tumors resistant will revert and EGFr inhibitors become effective again. So I wonder also if this dosing schedule and concentration used in the trial isn't working similarly. Hitting the tumor hard, relaxing, and not enabling the tumor to slide into the alternative signaling pathway. Many questions that hopefully this trial will answer. I wonder if they would consider using Dacomitinib in an arm of the crowd funded trial also? Regards, GrouseMan Good points and questions GrouseMan, thanks- First of all, I wish you wife good results on her trial! In terms of your points; - I think a mechanistic goal of delaying resistance via pulse dosing is very much on their minds. - You raise an interesting question re: Dacomitinib. The final trial protocol has not been written yet - I will discuss it with the PI! - I think they are intentionally focusing on using a LMW EGFR inhibitor to have a better dosing controlled PK (cetuximab's PK is quite variable between people and can have a very long half-life). I am a big fan of alternative dose schedules in general when there is a strong scientific basis to try. Cheers, -DK",avastin,2,,,

"Iâ€™ve been interested in intraocular sustained drug delivery systems for years, and I have participated in clinical trials of several delivery systems. This article describes a recently developed technology designed to deliver fluocinolone acetonide to treat patients with uveitis over a sustained period with an approach that is less invasive than currently available surgically implanted systems.  AT A GLANCE â€¢ The surgically implanted fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.59 mg is effective for treating chronic uveitis. â€¢ However, it requires surgical placement and it can cause cataract formation and elevated intraocular pressure. â€¢ A less invasive 0.18 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant, delivered by injection, is pending FDA approval for treatment of uveitis. THE ORIGINAL INTRAVITREAL FLUOCINOLONE ACETONIDE IMPLANT Fluocinolone acetonide is an insoluble, lipophilic synthetic corticosteroid. The first surgically implanted fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant I evaluated was a prototype that looked like an elongated cylinder. We implanted it into the eye of a patient with severe panuveitis, and we were able to control the inflammation. It was predicted that this delivery system could release the drug for up to 18 years, but it was not deemed to be practical for further development because there would be no way to design a study to assess how well this system worked (everyone involved, including many of the patients and most of the investigators, would be long gone by the time the drug was depleted). I was also involved in the clinical evaluation of a next-generation device, the surgically implanted fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.59 mg (Retisert, Bausch + Lomb/Valeant), which was designed to release the drug for roughly 3 years. The US FDA approved the implant based on results from two phase 3 studies. 1 The implant is indicated for treatment of patients with chronic uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (ie, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis). I still find this drug delivery system to be useful, and I use it in patients who are either intolerant of systemic medications or who have unilateral disease, usually with macular edema and no systemic findings.  OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT The surgically implanted 0.59 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant is effective, but it can cause cataract formation and elevate intraocular pressure (IOP). It is important to note that cataract occurs within 3 years in virtually every phakic patient receiving this implant. 1 In fact, whether in a sustained drug delivery system or not, if a steroid is administered frequently enough over a long enough time period, it will cause a cataract. The rise in IOP with this implant, although controllable, often requires a glaucoma procedure, which is another drawback. Additionally, the 0.59 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant must be surgically implanted in the OR. What if a less invasive option were available? That was the underlying idea for the development of a three-year injectable fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.18 mg by EyePoint Pharmaceuticals using the companyâ€™s Durasert Technology.  CLINICAL EVALUATION A fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.19 mg, under the name Iluvien (Alimera Sciences) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in IOP. 2 Alimera Sciences has the licensing rights for the DME indication. EyePoint (formerly pSivida) has retained the licensing rights to develop the implant for use in patients with uveitis. (Meanwhile, Alimera is seeking approval in the European Union for use of Iluvien in the treatment of noninfectious posterior uveitis under its licensing agreement with EyePoint. 3,4 ) Pilot Study Before a new indication can be added for a drug, clinical testing is required. I performed a pilot investigator-initiated study (IIS) of the injectable 0.18 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant in patients with posterior uveitis. 5 I was at first provided with injectable fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implants with two release rates to treat patients with intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis. The study was later modified to include only the 0.2 Âµg/day implant, the commercially available version. In this pilot trial, the implant was placed in 11 eyes of 11 patients with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis. 6 The primary endpoint was change in status of uveitis in the study eye. We looked at the rate of recurrence over time and at the status of the patientsâ€™ untreated fellow eyes as a comparison in 10 of the 11 eyes that had inflammation in both eyes. None of the eyes that received the implant had recurrent inflammation over the 2-year time period, whereas the patientsâ€™ less severely affected fellow eyes, which did not receive an implant, had significantly more recurrences and ultimately worse visual acuity. Based on the results of the IIS, it was decided to proceed with phase 3 trials, which were undertaken at centers in the United States, Europe, and India. 7,8 Phase 3 Trial Patients enrolled in the controlled phase 3 trials had chronic uveitis with recurrent inflammation for at least 1 year in at least one eye. 7,8 During the year before enrollment they had to have either two separate recurrences requiring treatment or to have been treated systemically with immunosuppressants or a steroid for at least 3 months or to have had at least two injections of local therapy. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either the injectable 0.19 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant or a sham procedure. The treatments were administered in the clinic. Results The primary endpoint was recurrence of uveitis in the study eye within 6 months. A secondary endpoint was recurrence of uveitis within 3 years. Other outcome measures included recurrence of uveitis in the fellow eye at 1 and 3 years. At 6 months, uveitis had recurred in 28% of treatment eyes, compared with 91% in the sham group. This difference was statistically significant. At 1 year the recurrence rate was 98% in sham-treated eyes and 38% in treated eyes. At 1 year, fewer treated eyes (14%) than untreated eyes (31%) lost 3 or more lines of visual acuity. In other words, about twice as many patients in the sham-treatment group had a 3-line or greater loss. 9  DISCUSSION Based on the results of the phase 3 trial, EyePoint submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA in January for its fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.18 mg (Durasert Three-year for Posterior Uveitis). 4 The NDA includes data from two phase 3 studies that each achieved their primary efficacy endpoint at 6 months. The safety profile of patients treated with the implant was consistent with the safety profile of other steroid treatments that are considered standard of care for this disease (the dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg [Ozurdex, Allergan] and the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.59 mg). The FDA has given the company a target date of November for a response to the NDA. Following are some observations based on my experience and the clinical trial record. Recurrent Inflammation In the IIS, I did not observe any recurrences of inflammation in patients through 2 years after implantation. We have seen some recurrences between 2 and 3 years, but weâ€™ve also had some patients who have had no recurrences. I believe those latter cases are not so much because we cured the disease but because the patientsâ€™ overall disease activity decreased over time. IOP Response IOP response to the steroid in general was quite low in the phase 3 study. At 12 months, three of 87 eyes in the implanted group (3.4%) ended up needing surgery to address IOP elevation compared with two of 42 patients in the sham-treated group (4.8%). There was minimal difference in the two groups, and my experience has been that patients who develop an IOP response tend to do so early on. If they havenâ€™t developed one by the end of year 1, odds are that they wonâ€™t have a problem. Additional Therapy Whether patients required additional systemic or local therapy is another important question because it gets at the potential for reduction in treatment burden. In the group that received the implant, 19.5% of patients needed systemic therapy, whereas 41% of patients who received sham injection required such therapy. That is, twice as many patients needed additional systemic therapy if they did not receive the implant. The need for local therapy (intra/periocular steroid injection) was also much greater in the sham group (62%) compared with the treatment group (7%).   Figure. Size comparison of 3-year injectable fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.18 mg (left) and surgically implanted fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 0.59 mg (right). DRAWING COMPARISONS Although the surgically implanted 0.59 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant and the injectable 0.18 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant contain the same drug, use a similar sustained-release technology, and are placed in the same anatomic location (the pars plana), the inserts are quite different. The 0.18 mg implant is a small, cylindrical polyimide tube that is injected through a 25-gauge needle injector and releases the drug from one end. The surgically implanted 0.59 mg implant is laminated with a coating of silicone and polyvinyl alcohol (Figure). The 0.59 mg implant releases the drug through a semipermeable membrane or port. One advantage of the surgically implanted drug delivery device comes into play in vitrectomized eyes because it stays in place and doesnâ€™t move around. Also, in aphakic eyes, the injected implant tends to move out of the field of vision and lodge in the vitreous base, but it could potentially migrate into the front of the eye and cause problems with the cornea. Another injected treatment option for patients with uveitis is the dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg. That implant, indicated for treatment of noninfectious posterior uveitis, lasts 6 weeks to 3 months and is often used in instances of severe inflammation.  LOOKING AHEAD The hope is that the injectable 0.18 mg fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant will achieve FDA approval later this year and become a viable option for physicians who want to provide long-term therapy to their patients with uveitis through an office-based procedure. 1.

I wish I had an answer that could make this all better. My husband has said some things that are insensitive- I just don't think some personalities understand how hurtful words can be especially when it is a joke about a topic you are Self-conscious of. In 2018 we welcomed our 2nd son. After his birth I spiraled with these insane infections. I had 4 skin infections that needed medical attention- one the required hospitalization. I recently started the switch from Remicade to Entivyo to hopefully help the occurance of these skin infections. However, about two weeks ago I got out of the shower and noticed small red circle spots up and down my arms. I was thinking that it was either eczema or my psoriasis was coming back. My husband at that time decided to say ""you have more skin issues than anyone i know"". I was absolutely hurt and crushed. I am so self-conscious of my looks, especially because of the skin issues I have had since dianosed with UC in 2010. I told him that his comment was hurtful and explained... he apolozied, similar to your spouse, but it doesn't erase the insecurity that was caused by his comment. Thankfully a little coconut oil cleared up the spots but I will always remember his remark any time there is the tinest flaw in my skin. I currently see a therapist which has helped me with working through my emotions. My UC is very much stressed induced and with two little ones, stress is a common theme in my personal life. I also work full time- so my life is constant insanity. Perhaps seeing a therapist, if you don't already, can help you channel some of your emotions? Some personalities just don't understand that sometimes we just want our feelings to be taken into consideration. I dont know if you've watched the ""it's not about the nail"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg) but it is a great video that shows how sometimes men tend to want to fix our problems instead of listening to them.

"So yesterday morning Iâ€™m sitting here and I get a call from my insurance that the expedited review for ancillary services, a.k.a. the infusion , has not been deemed necessary. Therefore the review will be conducted at the usual standard time as per policy. WTF???? I thought the problem was they didnâ€™t order the drug? Turns out they never got authorization to get the drug or to administer it. Authorizations have to go to my doctor. My first step started when I called the insurance company. They told me it was never expedited, I shouldnâ€™t have received a phone call it was denied. To get it expedited I needed to call my doctorâ€™s office and have them request it. I called my doctors office, they are so wonderful there, thank God, however they never started the authorization process. So now we had to go back through the infusion center to find out who is doing what!!! This only took about seven phone calls back-and-forth but finally we got the answer send the forms over to get the review expedited as soon as possible. Great, or so I thought. On a completely different thing I decided to refill some of my every day medicines. I was getting a message saying to please contact my pharmacy because my insurance card on file has expired. Not knowing what that meant, I decided to make a phone call. They informed me that the system was saying I am no longer eligible with my insurance, emblem health. Since I am state health insurance, I first have to do my renewals through New York State Medicaid. Once thatâ€™s approved their system is updated which update the file for emblem health. Well for some reason I received a notice of discontinued from Medicaid in error this month. I got it all straightened out immediately and it was all fixed but guess what, the screens werenâ€™t updated so the insurance company had me as not eligible. I then had to sit on the phone with them for another hour while they contacted the state to find out that I was truly still eligible. They needed to verify that my recertification for the year was actually done and then their system needed to be updated. However insurance isnâ€™t quite as easy as that either and she had an out expedite the updated insurance screens with her company. As of end of day yesterday the still wasnâ€™t done. Ironically in the middle of all this I get a call from the authorization department telling me that my ancillary services was authorized. The pharmacy called me and said because my pharmacy services are ineligible if they order the medicine and something doesnâ€™t come out right I am legally responsible for the price of Ocrevus , would I like to wait until the insurance is fixed before they order it? I told them no, please order the medicine so I can get this done because I know I am eligible and everything will be fine. I literally was on the phone with all different parts of my insurance for the entire day yesterday. Itâ€™s a good thing I donâ€™t have a full-time job, because this is my full-time job. Can you imagine? I canâ€™t make this stuff up.",ocrevus,2,,,

"HEALTH NEWS OCTOBER 3, 2018 Ben Hirschler LONDON (Reuters) - Frustrated by delays in new medicines reaching their own country, a small but growing number of patients are turning to an online broker that bills itself as a legal version of the Dallas Buyers Club. While regulators warn of the risk of buying drugs online, the Amsterdam-based Social Medwork sees its network of trusted suppliers as filling a gap in the market for the latest drugs against diseases such as cancer, migraine and multiple sclerosis. Now it is looking to raise its profile and expand, by signing up former EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes to its supervisory board and securing 1.5 million euros ($1.73 million) in new funding from the Social Impact Ventures capital fund. Like Ron Woodroof, the 1980s AIDS patient in the movie â€˜Dallas Buyers Clubâ€™, patients who cannot get the drugs they want through local healthcare systems are using the organization to self-import medicines from abroad. But while Woodroof had to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border, the Social Medworkâ€™s customers can place orders online legally, as long as they have a prescription and a doctorâ€™s letter stating that the drug is strictly for personal use. In the past 18 months, the group, which is registered with the Dutch Ministry of Health as a medicines intermediary, has supplied more than 3,000 patients. They include British migraine sufferer Senty Bera, 43, who recently used the system to buy Aimovig, a new monthly migraine injection from Amgen and Novartis, the first in an improved class of drugs that target a chemical involved in triggering attacks. â€œMy quality of life was so poor I thought it was worth trying and it is working brilliantly,â€ Bera said. As yet, Aimovig is not approved for use within Britainâ€™s state health service - though Bera hopes it will be soon - but its reputation means it is one of Social Medworkâ€™s top-sellers, despite a price tag of 698 euros for two autoinjectors. A spokeswoman for Britainâ€™s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed there were no formal restrictions on importing such medicines for personal use. In the past, informal drug-buying networks here have helped supply cheap generic versions of treatments for HIV and hepatitis C. But the Dutch group, which charges a fee of around 6 percent, claims to be the only organization focused on newly approved branded drugs.

REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic/File Photo With customers in 70 countries, its line-up includes new cancer drugs that are U.S.-approved but not yet available elsewhere, as well as medicines for chronic disorders, such as Rocheâ€™s new multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus. Founder Sjaak Vink says the Internet means patients are increasingly aware they may be waiting months or even years for novel drugs following a first approval elsewhere. â€œWe really need to bridge this gap because this situation is ridiculous,â€ he said in an interview. Vink said he was inspired to found the organization by delays in European availability of Merck & Coâ€™s innovative cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Today, his group has customers in Australia, the Middle East and Asia, as well as major European markets such as France, Italy, Germany and Britain, where drug delays could worsen if Brexit disrupts supply lines. Given relatively speedy U.S. approvals, there are currently fewer customers in America, although there was a spike in U.S. demand last year for Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaâ€™s amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug Radicut/Radicava, which was approved first in Japan.",ocrevus,2,,,
"If you meet someone, and they tell you they have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), what should you do? Hmm, the best thing to do first is to say hello! Donâ€™t feel sorry for them, donâ€™t tell them about your sisterâ€™s next door neighbourâ€™s cousin who cured themselves of MS, and certainly donâ€™t assume you know more about the disease than they do.   Iâ€™ve know I have MS since 2010, and probably had it for five or so years beforehand, according to my neurologist. I have suffered from these ill-informed responses quite a few times in my â€˜careerâ€™ as a person with MS. Having MS can be a terrible thing, it can be a trial, an irritation, or sometimes it can be a little bit of not much at all. It all depends on how the disease is going for the person, what their situation is regarding how theyâ€™re coping, what the weatherâ€™s like, and a large variety of other things. I have MS, but I would never assume I know more about another personâ€™s experiences than they know about how it is for themselves. Iâ€™m doing well with my current medication, Gilenya , but I know other people who did badly with it. I also know people who are on a medication Iâ€™ve been on, and theyâ€™re doing extremely will with it, whereas I only did OK with it, rather than extremely well. I think the best thing to do if and when you meet a person with MS is to let them lead the conversation. Some people are happy to talk about their MS situation, others are bored by such talk, and still others donâ€™t want to discuss it at all. Thatâ€™s the thing about people, theyâ€™re all different, and with MS, peoplesâ€™ experiences can be all different too. When you have a disease that differs in the symptoms, depending on where in your body the damage has happened or is still happening, the symptoms can all be quite different. Some people with MS suffer from Optic Neuritis , but I have no problems with my own eyes from MS, apart from being short sighted. Other people suffer from pain, whereas I would say I only suffer pain when I fall over! And thatâ€™s one thing most people with MS will agree with, they fall over more than people without MS. I also like to talk to people, so will happily launch So, if you meet a person who has MS, why not just say hi, maybe talk about the weather to start with, and just see how the conversation goes!",gilenya,2,,,
"Wow! I am surprised that there is nothing posted under Gilenya since March. Does this mean that everyone who is taking it, is doing great on it, without any major side affect? or has everyone moved on to something else, and if so, what was the reason. I recently started Gilenya and I am still a bit nervous about it and would like to hear others experience with it. Thank you in advance!",gilenya,2,,,
"It is fairly common for people to be dosed at 10mg/kg every 4 weeks. I didn't have to fight my insurance at all to get the 4 week dosing. If your insurance denies it, the doc should be able to appeal it. However, any dosing above that would be pretty difficult to get approved. That said, if you flare after 2 weeks, it is not likely that switching to every 4 weeks will get you into a solid remission. If adding an immunomodulator (6-MP can take 3-6 months to work) and upping to 4 weeks doesn't work, I'd move on to Simponi. Entyvio is also an option but given that you have severe pancolitis, I'd be worried that you could lose your colon before the Entyvio takes full effect. Depending on how liberal your insurance is, Xeljanz (a JAK inhibitor rather than a biologic) might also be an option. The advantage of Xeljanz would be that it only takes 8-10 weeks to tell if it will work for you.",simponi,2,,,

"1. Zolgensma â€“ the $4m per patient gene therapy The first CAR-T cell therapies, Novartisâ€™ Kymriah and Gilead/Kiteâ€™s Yescarta, were launched in Europe in 2018, while Sparkâ€™s gene therapy Luxturna was also approved in Europe late in the year. Novartis has a deal with Spark to market Luxturna in Europe, and is therefore at the forefront of not only the groundbreaking R&D behind cell and gene therapy, but is also looking to lead the revolution in pricing and reimbursement required to make them a commercial success. The next step in this process is the launch of Zolgensma (AveXis) â€“ the gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) which is now filed with the FDA and EMA, and is set to gain approval in both regions in the first half of 2019. Novartis hit the headlines when it suggested its price for Zolgensma could be around the $4m (â‚¬3.5bn) mark â€“ which would make it easily the most expensive biopharma product ever. The company says the price would be justified, based on the fact that patients require just one infusion of the gene therapy, rather than the long-term treatment required with the only other SMA treatment available, Biogenâ€™s Spinraza. The company argues that current ten- year costs of caring for SMA type 1 patients with Spinraza and additional care costs are somewhere between $2.5-$5m.  Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan says the company is exploring a novel reinsurance model in which a third party would underwrite the â€œcatastrophic caseâ€ of a child having one of these rare conditions. 2. AR101 â€“ the first peanut allergy treatment Potentially deadly allergies to food and other everyday substances are on the rise around the world â€“ and there are currently very few therapies to help prevent the life-threatening anaphylaxis that can result. Now a US biotech company, Aimmune, looks set to bring the first treatment to market by the end of this year. There are more than 1.5 million peanut allergy sufferers in the US, with a similar number in Europe. Analysts say the market could eventually be worth $4.8bn annually. The FDA granted AR101 Fast Track Designation for peanut allergy in September 2014 and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for peanut allergy in ages 4â€“17 in June 2015. Aimmune Therapeutics submitted the drug to the FDA on 21 December. However the company, like many others, is at the mercy of the US government shutdown , which means many FDA staff are on unpaid leave, and threatens drug approval timelines if it drags on any longer. In Europe, the company expects to file with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first half of 2019. 3. Epidiolex â€“ leading the flowering therapeutic cannabinoid market  The last 12 months have seen a huge growth in interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabis, with authorities now allowing regulated access to a new generation of products. A handful of legitimate companies is now pioneering these products, led by GW Pharma, the UK-headquartered firm that has been working in the area since the late 1990s. GW Pharma gained an historic approval for its drug Epidiolex from the FDA in June last year, becoming the first ever prescription medicine derived from cannabis. Epidiolex is the first medicine based on highly purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), which lacks the high associated with marijuana, and is the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). The oral solution treats seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age or older, two of the most difficult-to-treat epilepsy-related conditions. Analysts believe if GW Pharma can successfully commercialise the drug in the US and other major global markets, and add further indications, it could have a blockbuster treatment on its hands worth $2-$3bn a year. The company had to wait until November before it could launch the product, however, because its active ingredient, CBD, needed to be rescheduled under US law. Similar changes have been required in Europe, but now the company looks set for launch later this year, with final regulatory approval in Q1 2019. The company is rapidly establishing a European corporate infrastructure, led by Chief Operating Officer Chris Tovey, who is hiring staff in medical affairs, market access and marketing, and selecting candidates with a strong epilepsy or specialist disease experience. 4. Mayzent â€“ a latest addition to competitive MS market Novartisâ€™ Mayzent (siponimod) is expected to be launched in the US in Q1 for multiple sclerosis, with an EU launch to follow later this year. The company says its latest trial results are the first and only study in secondary progressive MS to show meaningful results. Its success is vital, as Novartisâ€™ $3.2bn franchise for Gilenya is facing increased competition. Analysts predict peak sales of up to $3bn. 5. Ultomiris â€“ Alexionâ€™s follow-up to Soliris  Alexion is bracing for the patent expiry of its blockbuster Soliris (eculizumab), used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and myasthenia gravis, which hit revenues of around $3bn in 2018. The follow-up, Ultomiris ALXN1210, is a second-generation PNH therapy with an NPV of $10.9bn. The drug matched Soliris for efficacy with a trend towards superiority and has improved dosing. It gained earlier than expected FDA approval on 21 December. 6. Takhzyro â€“ post-merger Takedaâ€™s debut launch Takedaâ€™s chief executive Christophe Weber has staked his reputation on the companyâ€™s Â£46bn ($61bn) takeover of Shire , and now needs to demonstrate that the combined company will have more marketing muscle than before. The first test of this will be Shireâ€™s new blockbuster-in-waiting Takhzyro, which gained EMA approval in November, for the rare disease hereditary angioedema (HAE). The EU regulator has cleared Takhzyro (lanadelumab) for the preventive treatment of HAE in patients aged over 12, based on clinical data showing that the drug can reduce HAE attacks â€“ typically swelling in areas of the body such as the abdomen, face, feet, genitals, hands and throat â€“ by 87% versus placebo. Analysts predict the drug could make up to $2bn in peak sales, making it one of the brightest prospects in Shireâ€™s pipeline. EU approval follows a green light in the US in August.  Takhzyro is the first antibody to be approved for HAE in a market of a handful of existing treatments, including Shireâ€™s three existing products, Cinryze, Firazyr and Kalbitor), that collectively made more than $1bn in sales in the first nine months of the year. Almost all sales come from the US market, mainly because of supply constraints for Cinryze in recent years, something that the combined company will aim to address. The company maintains that Takhzyro has the potential to expand the HAE prevention market, particularly in international markets, as it is easier to administer than other drugs. Itâ€™s given as a subcutaneous injection that takes less than a minute to deliver every two weeks, around 75% fewer injections than other products for HAE prevention. Its early US take-up is encouraging, according to Shire, with Q3 sales coming in at $51m. At the moment Shireâ€™s big competitor in HAE is CSL with its Haegarda product, a subcutaneous medicine that launched last year and has been trying to steal market share from Cinryze, which is administered intravenously twice a week. Analysts at Bernstein recently predicted that Takhzyro will eventually dominate the HAE prophylaxis market with a 70% share. 7. LentiGlobin TDT â€“ a gene therapy first for Europe Gene therapy company Bluebird Bio is on course to gain approval for its first product this year â€“ and Europe is expected to approve it ahead of the US. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm filed its gene therapy LentiGlobin TDT with the EMA last year, a treatment for adolescent and adult patients with transfusion- dependent Î²-thalassemia (TDT) and a non-Î²0/Î²0 genotype. Pivotal data from two studies in the severe inherited blood condition suggests the gene therapy could transform care of the disease by providing a cure for many patients. In one recently presented study, seven out of eight patients no longer needed long-term blood transfusions, and continued to show normal levels of haemoglobin. Bluebird says its decision to file in Europe first was in part thanks to LentiGlobin being accepted on to the EMAâ€™s PRIME fast track designation, which allows early discussions about data requirements and trial design in groundbreaking therapies.  Analysts William Blair forecast that LentiGlobin could eventually hit global peak revenues of $800m in TDT, but this would depend on its efficacy in the harder to treat Î²0/Î²0 genotype patients, who have more severe thalassemia. The analysts predict the drug will be priced at around $550,000 (â‚¬472,000) per treatment, a level that compares favourably with the cost of conventional stem cell therapy of $500,000 to $1m. Unlike fellow Boston, MA-based gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics, Bluebird (led by CEO Nick Leschly, above) has opted to market its own products in Europe as well as the US. It has a regulatory, marketing and market access team already in place in Europe, and is in advanced discussions with the continentâ€™s payers, including value-based payment systems. 8. Daurismo â€“ a new wave of AML treatment After many years with no new therapies, the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is set for rapid change, thanks to a wave of rival products arriving on the market. These include Pfizerâ€™s Daurismo , the first smoothened (SMO) receptor inhibitor to be approved for blood cancer. The FDA cleared Daurismo (glasdegib) in late November for use in combination with low-dose cytarabine for patients with newly-diagnosed AML â€“ aged 75 or over â€“ who are too frail to be treated with intensive chemotherapy. The FDA also approved AbbVie and Rocheâ€™s Venclexta (venetoclax) with cytarabine or a hypomethylating agent (azacitidine or decitabine) for the exact same indication â€“ adding to the options for this patient population and taking the total number of new drugs for AML in the last couple of years to seven, after decades of stagnation. Phase 2 data submitted in support of the Daurismo marketing application shows that combining Daurismo with cytarabine reduced the risk of death by 54% compared to cytarabine alone in these patients. The small-molecule drug blocks part of the Sonic hedgehog pathway, which is also targeted by other cancer drugs including Rocheâ€™s Erivedge (vismodegib) and Novartisâ€™ Odomzo (sonidegib) for basal cell carcinoma, which has a smaller patient population than AML.  Analysts at Credit Suisse have predicted approval in AML could make glasdegib a $450m product by 2020, with an additional upside if Pfizer can also get approvals in other indications such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and solid tumours. Meanwhile, Venclextaâ€™s latest approval adds to the growing momentum behind AbbVie and Rocheâ€™s BCL-2 inhibitor, which has also been filed for approval for previously untreated AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, to go along with its existing indications in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). EvaluatePharma has predicted it could become a nearly $2.5bn product by 2024, providing it can also pick up approvals in AML and other indications like multiple myeloma. 9. Vitrakvi â€“ a novel addition to the immune-oncology market Earlier this year Merck & Co/MSD became the first company to secure approval for a â€˜tissue agnosticâ€™ drug when its PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) was backed for cancers harbouring a biomarker known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). Merck/MSD looks to have gained a dominant position in checkpoint inhibitor immuno-oncology (IO) with Keytruda â€“ but there remains room for growth in the market via new IO agents. This is particularly the case for the considerable percentage of patients who donâ€™t respond to any existing IO treatments. Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) gained FDA approval in late November to treat any solid tumours that have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, which causes the production of TRK, a family of proteins that drives tumour growth.  This is the first US product approval for Loxo Oncology and its marketing partner Bayer, becoming the second company to get FDA backing for a drug that treats cancer based on a specific genetic mutation rather than its location in the body. In Europe, a marketing application for larotrectinib was submitted to the EMA last August, setting up a potential approval in mid-2019. Analysts at Oppenheimer predict annual sales of Vikrakvi will grow to more than $1bn by 2024, thanks to impressive results in clinical trials. NTRK fusions are rare â€“ Loxo estimates that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 new cases of advanced NTRK fusion cancer in the US each year â€“ so the big challenge for Loxo and Bayer will be to encourage oncologists to test for them and identify patients who may be eligible for Vitrakvi, which will launch with a premium price tag of $393,600 per year. However, Bayer is offering a refund for patients who donâ€™t see a benefit from the drug within three months. At the moment there is no companion diagnostic for NTRK fusions so patients need to be identified through genomic profiling techniques such as immunohistochemistry or genetic sequencing approaches, which tend to be available only through specialist centres. The company says it is critical for screening of patients of all ages with advanced solid tumours for â€˜actionable genomic insightsâ€™ to improve care or inclusion in clinical trials. Loxo has brought its drug to market ahead of main rival entrectinib from Roche, which is in late-stage testing and could be submitted for approval before the end of the year. 10. Erleada â€“ the next generation prostate cancer treatment  Johnson & Johnson gained FDA approval for Erleada in February 2018, and it just got the go ahead in Europe as the first treatment for non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Erleada (apalutamide) is the first drug to be cleared on the strength of metastasis-free survival (MFS), a trial endpoint not used before in any FDA cancer drug approval. Analysts believe the drug could achieve peak sales of around $1.7bn, but will face fierce competition from the likes of Pfizer and Astellasâ€™ established Xtandi. Around 10-20% of prostate cancer cases are castration-resistant, and up to 16% of these patients show no evidence that the cancer has spread at the time of the castration-resistant diagnosis. In patients with non-metastatic CRPC, there is a high unmet need to delay development of metastases and the progression to advanced prostate cancer. Erleada was approved on data from the SPARTAN study, which involved over 1,200 patients with non-metastatic CRPC who received either Erleada or placebo on top of hormone therapy with gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues or with surgical castration. The median MFS for patients taking Erleada was 40.5 months compared to 16.2 months for the placebo arm. J&J needs the drug to hit the ground running because its existing prostate cancer blockbuster Zytiga is faceing generic competition in the US, which accounts for around half of the drugâ€™s $2.5bn revenues. It also gives J&J a leg-up in what looks set to be a big market tussle with Pfizer and Astellas and their Xtandi product, which has also been filed for approval in the US and EU for non-metastatic CRPC on the strength of MFS data from the PROSPER trial. 11. Buvidal â€“ an advance in opioid dependence treatment Opioid addiction has surged in the US since the 1990s, when prescription drugs such as OxyContin and Vicodin became a common remedy for a number of conditions. Last year, more than 47,600 Americans died from overdosing on opioids. About 2.5m people have been diagnosed with opioid dependence in the US, and almost one million are receiving treatment. While the problem is not as acute in Europe, it is nevertheless still a significant and growing issue across the continent. Now there is a growing need for treatments which can help wean dependent patients off these prescription drugs, or the street drugs to which many transition. New to the opioid dependence treatment market this year is CAM2038, marketed by Camurus, a company headquartered in Lund, Sweden. CAM2038 is an injectable solution that slowly releases buprenorphine â€“ the most common drug used to treat opioid addiction â€“ into the body, eliminating the need for daily dosages as well as the risk of the substance making its way onto the black market. The product gained EMA approval in November and FDA approval on 26 December. Camurus is currently preparing to launch the drug in the first European markets as early as January, and expects â€˜substantialâ€™ sales of the treatment during 2019, although it will take three to six months to ramp up. In the long term, a US market share of 10% of the number of patients treated, or about $1.4bn in annual sales is expected. The US market for the treatment of opioid addiction is currently dominated by Indivorâ€™s Suboxone, a film that is placed under the tongue once a day. The advantage of treatments such as CAM2038 is that the patient gets continuous treatment without running the risk of missing doses and without having to visit clinics between injections. While most treatments today are taken in daily doses, the use of long-acting injections is expected to increase in coming years. Compared with a similar treatment marketed by Indivior , the drug has advantages in flexibility. Injection volumes are lower, it can be taken weekly as well as monthly and can be administered to different parts of the body. 12/13. Upadacitinib + Risankizumab â€“ twin anti- inflammation blockbusters in the making The worldâ€™s biggest selling drug, Humira, lost its market exclusivity in Europe to biosimilar competition in 2018, and AbbVie is well aware of the impending US patent expiry in 2022. The good news for the company is that it has not one but two potential blockbusters likely to gain approval in 2019: Upadacitinib (AbbVie) for RA and risankizumab (co-marketed with Boehringer Ingelheim) for psoriatic arthritis, Crohnâ€™s disease and other inflammatory conditions. Humira reached revenues of around $20bn in 2018, meaning AbbVie will soon have a very large hole in its revenues to fill. It sees upadacitinib as a key component of its post-Humira portfolio, and predicts the drug could eventually hit sales of $6.5bn a year, with risankizumab adding another $4bn-$5bn at peak.  AbbVie presented new data on its risankizumab candidate in psoriasis and upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis that suggest it has a potentially lucrative dermatology franchise on the way. It announced the filing of upadacitinib in the US and Europe on 20 December, with the filing of risankizumab expected early this year. Three studies of its interleukin-23 inhibitor risankizumab in psoriasis were presented in 2018 â€“ firming up the case for the drug ahead of possible regulatory approvals. It also unveiled mid-stage data on its JAK1 inhibitor upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis, adding another clinical win to earlier successes in rheumatoid arthritis. For risankizumab, the new data could be important to help AbbVie differentiate its IL-23 inhibitor from a clutch of new psoriasis treatments from Novartis, Lilly and J&J and others jostling for space in an increasingly crowded market. The analysis concentrated on patient-reported outcomes data from two studies that compared risankizumab to J&Jâ€™s $4bn-a-year IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor Stelara (ustekinumab) and one against its own TNF inhibitor Humira (adalimumab), currently the biggest-selling drug in the world with revenues of $16bn in 2017. The analysis showed that 56% of patients on risankizumab were symptom-free after a yearâ€™s treatment, compared to 30% of the Stelara group. There were also significant improvements for AbbVieâ€™s drug over Humira on quality of life measures and over Stelara on anxiety and depression, and risankizumab did better than both comparator drugs when it came to keeping patients in work without loss of productivity caused by the skin disorder. Meanwhile, phase 2b results for upadacitinib showed that the drug was able to improve skin lesions and itching in patients with moderate-to- severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) across all doses tested, with a sustained treatment effect over 32 weeks. Upadacitinib is already in a phase 3 trial in atopic dermatitis and picked up a breakthrough designation (BTD) from the FDA for this indication earlier this year. AbbVie has five trials on the go in rheumatoid arthritis and will be filing in that indication before the end of the year. The new data in atopic dermatitis puts it on course for an additional indication for the drug that some analysts predict could unlock a billion- dollar-plus market, although AbbVie isnâ€™t the only oral JAK inhibitor developer with its eye on that particular prize. Lillyâ€™s already-approved Olumiant (baricitinib) and Pfizerâ€™s PF-04965842 are rivals for Abbvieâ€™s upadacitinib, but Gilead and Galapagosâ€™ filgotinib (an AbbVie cast-off) now looks like the biggest competitive threat. It is also in a phase 2 trial in atopic dermatitis. Risankizumab is almost inevitably going to have a tough time clawing out market share in the increasingly competitive moderate-to-severe psoriasis market, with several new injectables and potentially also new oral therapies such as Tyk inhibitors from Bristol-Myers Squibb and others, but outcomes data could help AbbVie persuade prescribers to plump for its drug, assuming it gets regulatory approvals. Likewise, upadacitinib will face competition in both RA and atopic dermatitis, particularly from filgotinib. Finally, 2019 will see a rapid increase in the uptake of Humira biosimilars across Europe, another factor that will temper demand for new agents, and up the ante in terms of price and competition in these therapy areas.",humira,2,,,

At first they Western Eye said it was Extrafovial choroidal neovascularization, which is on the outer rim and not ready for injections, but yesterday i had a second private opinion from a guy called Kashif Qureshi at the London Eye Hospital in Harley Street who told me that it was extremely urgent that I had the injection that day. I rushed over to the Western Eye and had my first Eylea injection yesterday afternoon. Wow, I didnt know what to expect, its really scarey. I had a bad reaction probably because it was the first one. Im ok today but last night after the injections was very frightening. The doctor who saw me gave me lots of positive feedback about these injections so Im living in hope. I also have something called Charles Bonnet syndrome which are hallucinations. I asked the private doctor about them and he said hopefully they would get less and less after the injections kick in. Its nice to be on this site and hear all about my fellow sufferers. Gotta be strong.",eylea,2,,,

"Hi all,
 My dad (64 years old) found out on 2/28/18 that they suspected lung cancer following a CT scan.Â  It was confirmed and I got him in ASAP with Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.Â  After a PET scan, it was confirmed stage 4 NSCLC.Â  My hope was in the Opdivo/Yervoy clinical trial they were offering but was heartbroken to find out a few days ago after the PET scan that he did not qualify for the clinical trial because there wasn't a whole tumor they could safely remove, which is needed to qualify.Â  The 2 inch mass in his lungs is pressing a bit on the right ventricle of his heart.Â  They have not gone over the results from the PET scan, but the CT showed it looks to be contained to one lung, metastasis to the adrenals, and possibly in the fluid surrounding the one lung.Â  He has a needle biopsy set for next Thursday and he had the brain MRI yesterday.Â  No results, but I feel things are moving so slow.Â 
 Moffitt called the other day and said they want to get him into another clinical trial that they are researching there solely.Â  It is a combination of Keytruda and Vorinostat (Phase I/II).Â  I cannot find any info on this combination and something in my gut doesn't feel right about this.Â  I think his cancer should be hit aggressively at this stage, possibly a 2 chemo option with Keytruda together from my research.Â  To me, this trial seems like ""let's see how long we can extend his life"" rather than let's hit it as aggressively as we can in the hopes of shrinking tumors and make it to 5-6 years out mentality.Â 
 I am in the process of trying to get him into Baptist MD Anderson in Jacksonville (we live in Orlando) for a second opinion.Â  This seems like it's moving slow too.Â  They made an appointment for 4/2 for a second opinion but I'm trying to get that moved up.Â 
 Has anyone heard of Keytruda and Vorinostat being tested together?Â  And am I right to feel like this might not be the best first line of treatment for my dad at this point?Â  I am an only child, so I'm doing the best I can for my parents and my dad.Â  I do not want to make the wrong decisions for him as they are looking to me for significant help in this. I am determined to help him beat this!!
 Thanks for any help!!

"There are several drugs that target PD1 checkpoint. To make immunotherapy more effective they do now combinations with other drugs. The combinations have more responders and stronger response, but they also have more side effects. The following combinations that are now in clinical trials or have been approved. -Combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with other checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. Opdivo plus Yervoy) -combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with other immune modulators like ox-40 or ido etc antibodies -combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs -combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with radiation -combinations with targeted drugs On the other hand, there are other checkpoints like TIM-3 or LAG that can be targeted together with PD1. There are other immune cells that can kill cancer (NK cells and macrophages) The CD47 antibody removes ""don't eat me"" signal from cancer cells and as a result macrophages can engulf them. Agonists of TLR receptors activate immune cells of the innate immune system (dendritic cells and macrophages). They can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors. The cancer vaccines are getting more successful. They also can be used with other immunotherapies. Engineered T cells and TILs are being developed for different cancers. Chemokines and cytokines can be adjuvants with any immunotherapy. The problem of immunosupression should be addressed (Tregs, M2 macrophages, N2 neutrophils). To trial all these combinations in clinical studies will require several years, so we need to hang on a little longer until all these combos get approved",opdivo,2,,,

"Remission is the primary goal for people with Crohnâ€™s disease. Biologic therapies can help achieve remission by reducing symptoms, as well as healing damage to intestines caused by inflammation. Biologic therapies are usually prescribed in people with more severe Crohnâ€™s symptoms who havenâ€™t found relief with  other methods . Guidelines now recommend, however, that doctors prescribe biologics for patients with significant disease as a first-line approach, too. Biologic therapies work by blocking certain chemicals that cause inflammation in your intestines. Most biologics for Crohnâ€™s disease block a protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Other biologics block immune cells called integrins, and others act on proteins called interleukin-23 (IL-23) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). This is how biologic therapies stop inflammation in the gut. Anti-TNF biologics bind and block a protein that promotes inflammation in the intestines and also other organs and tissues. Many people benefit from these medications, sometimes seeing an improvement immediately, or anywhere up to eight weeks. The three anti-TNF biologics are Humira, Remicade, and Cimzia.  Humira Humira is a self-administered treatment following an initial demonstration by a healthcare professional. If your doctor decides you can handle the injections yourself, theyâ€™ll give you a set of pens with dosage-controlled medication inside. Youâ€™ll also be given instructions on how many injections to take for the first 30 days. After the initial 30-day period, patients typically use one Humira pen every two weeks.  Remicade Remicade may help patients gain control of flare-ups. It may also help maintain remission to prevent symptoms from returning. Remicade is given directly into the bloodstream. This allows it to work immediately to relieve symptoms. Itâ€™s administered in a medical facility. Experienced healthcare professionals will be close by to monitor for side effects during and after treatment. Remicade doesnâ€™t have to be taken every day. After three starter doses, a patient often sees benefits in as few as six doses per year. The downside is that Remicade must be given intravenously in a medical facility over a two-hour period.  Cimzia Cimzia is administered by a small injection. The injection can either be given in a doctorâ€™s office or at home. If you choose to receive treatment in a doctorâ€™s office, you have the option of receiving your treatment in powder form. The powder is mixed with sterile water and then injected. The other option is to use prefilled syringes. The syringes contain medication thatâ€™s already mixed in measured doses. These can be used at home or in a doctorâ€™s office. If you choose to do the treatments yourself, youâ€™ll get a package with two syringes and instructions on giving the treatment. After the first three doses, given every two weeks, you will be able to take Cimzia once every four weeks. The two anti-integrin biologics for Crohnâ€™s are Tysabri and Entyvio.  Tysabri This type of biologic prevents inflammation-causing white blood cells to enter tissues by blocking a protein on the surface of these cells. Tysabri is given intravenously every four weeks. It takes about an hour to receive the full dose. Patients are usually observed for an hour afterward. Tysabri is typically used for people who havenâ€™t responded well to or are intolerant of a TNF blocker, immunomodulator, or corticosteroid. Crohnâ€™s patients considering Tysabri should be aware of a very serious side effect. Tysabri users have an increased risk of developing a rare brain disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This results from a virus, which you can be tested for in advance. Any physician who prescribes Tysabri for Crohnâ€™s will warn patients of those risks. They will also explain how to enroll in a prescribing program called TOUCH. This program is the only way you can receive Tysabri.  Entyvio Like Tysabri, Entyvio is approved to treat adults with moderate to severe Crohnâ€™s disease who havenâ€™t responded well to, are intolerant of, or for other reasons canâ€™t take a TNF blocker, immunomodulator, or corticosteroid. It works similarly to Tysabri, acting on certain white blood cells to prevent them from causing the bowel inflammation associated with Crohnâ€™s. Entyvio, however, is gut-specific and doesn't appear to have the same risk of PML. Entyvio is given under a doctorâ€™s care as an intravenous infusion. Itâ€™s given over 30 minutes on the first day of therapy. Itâ€™s then repeated on week two, on week six, and every eight weeks thereafter. If no improvement in Crohnâ€™s disease symptoms occurs by week 14, Entyvio therapy should be discontinued. Prior to starting Entyvio, patients should be up-to-date on their immunizations.  Stelara The third class of biologics is the IL-12 and IL-23 agonists. Stelara is the drug in this class approved for treating adults with moderately to severe Crohn's who havenâ€™t responded well enough to conventional therapy. The drug targets specific proteins that play a key role in the inflammation process. Stelara is initially given intravenously under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The following doses can be given via an injection under the skin every eight weeks, either by a healthcare provider or self-administered by the patient with training.  Side effects Although  the benefits often far outweigh the risks , biologic therapies present serious side effects. The process of biologic therapy reduces the bodyâ€™s ability to fight infections. This can cause tuberculosis and other infections, including brain infections. Thereâ€™s also an increased chance of certain types of cancer in patients taking biologics, especially in younger patients. One is called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer is often fatal. Because some biologic therapies work differently than others, the side effects they may cause can also vary. Ask your doctor to thoroughly explain all possible side effects when discussing which biologic therapy is right for you.  Takeaway Biologics offer an advantage in treating Crohnâ€™s disease because these drugs are specifically targeted at the substances in your body that cause the bowel inflammation. Your doctor can  discuss all the options , their benefits and risks, and help you find the most effective treatment. In some cases, â€œbiosimilarsâ€ (generic versions of biologic drugs) may be available, which can manage your Crohnâ€™s and also save money. Your doctor can tell you if this is an option.",humira,2,,,
"Electrolytes are certain nutrients (or chemicals) present in your body that have many important functions â€” from regulating your heartbeat to allowing your muscles to contract so you can move. The major electrolytes found within the body include calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, phosphate and chloride. IBD can result in electrolyte imbalances for many reasons, ranging from dehydration due to high output ostomies, diarrhoea, sickness, heat or lack of absorption due to scarring in the intestines or resection. It is important to replace the missing electrolytes so that you become rebalanced. How this is done will depend on the severity of the imbalance. If you have a minor imbalance then dietary changes may be possible or drinking rehydration solutions is another option. Treatments for more severe cases include fluid replacement intravenously during a hospital stay.  Posted by IBD SuperHeroes 1 comment:  Email This BlogThis!

"in March 2018.  About CheckMate -214 CheckMate -214 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study evaluating the combination of Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the intermediate- and poor-risk study population, 425 patients received Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus Yervoy 1 mg/kg every three weeks for four doses, followed by Opdivo 3 mg/kg every two weeks, and 422 patients received sunitinib 50 mg once daily for four weeks, followed by two weeks off every cycle. The recommended dosing for the Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination is Opdivo 3 mg/kg followed by Yervoy 1 mg/kg each infused intravenously over 30 minutes on the same day every three weeks for four doses. After completing four doses of the combination, Opdivo should be administered intravenously 240 mg every two weeks over 30 minutes or 480 mg every four weeks over 60 minutes until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The co-primary efficacy outcome measures of the trial were overall survival, objective response rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) and progression-free survival as determined by an independent radiographic review committee (IRRC) in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status.  About Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for more than 140,000 deaths worldwide each year. Clear-cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80% to 90% of all patients. RCC is approximately twice as common in men as in women, with the highest rates of the disease in North America and Europe. Globally, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with metastatic, or advanced, kidney cancer is 12.1%.  Bristol-Myers Squibb: Advancing Oncology Research We are leading the scientific understanding of I-O through our extensive portfolio of investigational compounds and approved agents. Our differentiated clinical development program is studying broad patient populations across more than 50 types of cancers with 24 clinical-stage molecules designed to target different immune system pathways. Our deep expertise and innovative clinical trial designs position us to advance the I-O/I-O, I-O/chemotherapy, I-O/targeted therapies and I-O radiation therapies across multiple tumors and potentially deliver the next wave of therapies with a sense of urgency. We also continue to pioneer research that will help facilitate a deeper understanding of the role of immune biomarkers and how a patientâ€™s tumor biology can be used as a guide for treatment decisions throughout their journey. We understand making the promise of I-O a reality for the many patients who may benefit from these therapies requires not only innovation on our part but also close collaboration with leading experts in the field. Our partnerships with academia, government, advocacy and biotech companies support our collective goal of providing new treatment options to advance the standards of clinical practice.  About Opdivo Opdivo is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that is designed to uniquely harness the bodyâ€™s own immune system to help restore anti-tumor immune response.

Opdivoâ€™s leading global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibbâ€™s scientific expertise in the field of Immuno-Oncology, and includes a broad range of clinical trials across all phases, including Phase 3, in a variety of tumor types. To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 25,000 patients. The Opdivo trials have contributed to gaining a deeper understanding of the potential role of biomarkers in patient care, particularly regarding how patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.",opdivo,2,,,
"My thoughts on this are also very negative. We know that the FDA and EMA are considering the use of Ocrevus and NICE needs to approve it's use for the NHS. According to Professor Giovannoni who says and I quote ' Uk patients may be disappointed as it may be hard for the NHS to fund everyone getting a drug that is likely to be expensive. I would expect a narrow group of people to be eligible', which to me means either 1, a postcode lottery, treatment depending on where you live. 2, a narrow group of people i.e people with primary and secondary ms. We've been the poor relations of the ms family for many years and deserve this treatment. 3, The NHS will not get funding so we will have to get a private prescription for the drug which most people will not be able to afford, for example the drug Sativex not approved by NHS England and costs more than Â£400 a month for a private prescription, i don't think many of us could afford that and i hate to think how much Ocrevus would cost. Ok, to sum up I think it will have a very restrictive use which will be very disappointing for many people, people who over the years have donated hundreds or even thousands of pounds to find a treatment or hopefully a cure only to find that if you don't live in the right area, have medical insurance or are wealthy enough you don't get the treatment.

"Thoughts and prayers coming your way Jake. Hope things work out well. Give us an update as soon as you're able to. My daughter was diagnosed Feb. 19/07, (13 yrs. old at time of diagnosis), with Crohn's of the Terminal Illium. Has used Prednisone and Pentasa. Started Imuran (02/09), had an abdominal abscess (12/08). 2cm of Stricture. Started Remicade in Feb. 2014, along with 100mgs. of Imuran.   JakeB Regular Member Joined : Dec 2008 Posts : 109 Posted 4/12/2018 6:20 PM (GMT -6) So the surgery ended up uncovering some sort of disturbing news. I now have a form of small bowel cancer with a very small tumor that they uncovered. The fortunate part is that they think that the removal of the tumor and some chemotherapy will take care of it. The issues I have been having more than likely been due to the cancer. They still had to remove about 60 cm of my jejunum, to which I now have less than half of my small bowel remaining. They want to continue some of the TPN after I leave recovery to help offset some of the loss of nutrients. Also now have to see an oncologist after all of this, but at least it isn't urgent in their minds. Pain was excrutiating yesterday, but they got it under control and doing much better today. Walked a couple times, without huge issues with pain, so that also made me feel good. All in all, a mixed bag of things... but I am trying to err on the side of positive. The cancer thing for some reason didn't really shake me much, but I think it is because I have come to expect anything these days. Thank you all for the constant support.

I just want you to know I am sorry you are going thru this. You are in my thoughts and prayers. In 2016 I had been on Remicade for awhile and I had been having issues and then short moments of calm in between. In June I had a partial obstruction. They did a scope, everything looked good except for a soft tissue inflammation/stricture area in my sigmoid. We were sure it would go away. They sent me home and I returned with in 3 days in excruciating pain. That happened a few more times in June and July. In August I was so ill they just kept me. In September I ended up with a colostomy. I was just so relieved to have the pain gone. My surgeon said that most of the inflamed area had atrophied and it was predysplasia. They believed that they got all of mine out with surgery. The following year they did not find any cancer during my scope. They will check it again this year...and every year going forward. It is a challenging road to travel on. I do believe that sometimes, if we are very lucky and listen very closely to our bodies, we get signs or symptoms that are alert ing us that there is something we need to have seen.

I accepted one on Dec.04 at a very senior level with a major pharma company in another state with a starting date in first week of January 2019. I always struggled with depression and high anxiety due to high job demands and a lot of travel. At times I would have short breath that my doctor and I would attribute to anxiety and that is I what I thought was the reason when I started feeling shortness of breath as I furiously continued with my job hunting in Nov.2018 My symptoms escalated days after accepting my Job offer and ended up in the emergency room. X-ray, CT scan and fluid test (from thoracentesis) confirmed I had malignant pleural effusion involving my left lung. Later on Dec.21, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR +ive mutation. I started the targeted therapy with â€œTagrissoâ€ 6 days ago and already feel better with my symptoms except for my cough, although less frequent but remains. My enormous dread has been replaced with much hope, thanks to the targeted therapy and great medical team at MD Anderson Cancer Center of Summit Medical NJ. However I am struggling with added fear of being without job and health insurance for the first time in my life and more so my family especially my children will be without means and no insurance is just as dreadful as my cancer. I have no answers and no confirmed avenues on how I and my family will survive as I keep pushing with the will to live a healthy, happy and long life with a new normal. I take great solace from stories of survivors on this site and would love to connect with some of you if not all.",tagrisso,0,,,
This is the exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about . Who is romanticizing? I have not seen anything of the sort. Everyone says how freakin hard it was/is.

"I cannot express how much this medication has helped me. When I was first prescribed I was terrified of the reviews that is was super painful. I have severe psoriasis that covers >80% of my body. I was given the citrate-free injectable pens. When I say that I felt NOTHING, I mean NOTHING! I thought that I hadn't injected it yet. But no, there was the prick and all. My psoriasis, after ONLY 2 WEEKS of treatment is GONE. Only the white scars of where it has wrecked my body remain. This medication is INCREDIBLE, and has literally changed my life. My skin doesn't flake, ooze, it doesn't get super red and irritated, it doesn't sting with every movement like it did before starting this medicine. The best part, is if you go on the website and sign up for the humira card, your copay is ONLY 5 DOLLARS. FIVE FRICKEN DOLLARS WHEN THE MEDICATION ORIGINALLY COSTS $6000+!! This company is amazing.

"Hi Andrey, Currently there is no cure for MS, rather medications that can help manage various aspects of the disease: underlying disease course (DMT), symptom management and general well-being strategies that are beneficial in all types of MS. Ocrevus was approved for the treatment of early primary progressive MS (PPMS) in adults between the ages of 18 and 55 based on findings from the clinical trial ORATORIO. Early PPMS is defined by disease duration (length of time in years since diagnosis), and level of disability, in addition to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features characteristic of inflammation, indicating active disease. People outside of the age range of 18 to 55, or who have an EDSS score above 6.5 were not studied and as such the safety and efficacy of ocrelizumab is unknown. Health Canada is unable to provide authorization of a new drug (assess its safety and efficacy) without clinical trial data. Individuals interested in ocrelizumab but who are over the age of 55 are encouraged to speak to their neurologist. Disease modifying therapies (DMT) target inflammation, so people with progressive MS who do not have inflammatory activity do not generally benefit from these therapies. People with progressive MS and their health care teams can do a great deal to manage the disease including rehabilitation and symptom management. -Dr. K",ocrevus,0,,,

"Hi @LadyChellie ! I was diagnosed at 14, and I had my son at 24. We are actually currently trying for baby number 2. My first piece of advice if you havenâ€™t already is to talk with your doctor more about how best to handle your MS while trying to become pregnant and while pregnant as well. I was taking Gilenya, so our first plan of action was to stop taking that so that we could safely conceive. My pregnancy with my son was wonderful, and I did not experience hardly any MS symptoms at all. My biggest piece of advice to prepare for labor is once again to keep in communication with your doctor about what plan is right for you with your MS, and to remain as strong and active as possible. Wishing you the best on your pregnancy journey! If you have any other questions please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! -Calie, MultipleSclerosis.net Team Member",gilenya,2,,,

"Thanks to this forum, took mom to a university hospital for gene testing and the results were given to us today.  The results read ROS1 rearrangement intron 32 and under additional findings, it says tumor mutation burden TMB-Low; 3Muts/mb.  The therapies identified are Ceritinib and Crizotinib. How are these therapies different from one another?  No therapies were identified for the tumor mutation.  Also did not understand how the ROS1 was identified when the body of the report says it is unclear if oncogenic rearrangement is present. It does say an activating ROS1 rearrangement is present (fusion).  I read an old article written by Dr. West which said that patients with the ROS1 rearrangement respond favorably to Alimta as well and patients with ROS1 who respond to Alimta have waited to try Crizotinib as a later resort. Momâ€™s test report also states that patients with ROS1 rearrangement have exhibited longer progression free survival on Alimta. As mom is still responding to Alimta, no pleural effusion in 5 weeks, no breathlessness, appetite has returned,  should these results just be treated as important information and no changes in treatment be considered at this point? Her onc did not order this testing and we hope to discuss the results with the onc at momâ€™s next visit.  13 other variants were also identified but none of them hold significance as not much is known about them in scientific literature at this time is what the report said. One of the variants was ROS L567V.   If you could point me to articles or information about ROS1 as is pertinent to these results or if you could share any input, I would be grateful.

"From my reading, I believe the main side-effect problems relating to Avastin are the problems with dose splitting and the use of syringes intended for injections into the body being used for injections into the eye. There are, apparently, a number of lawsuits taking place in regard to these issues: schmidtlaw.com/avastin/ There are other issues, well, one at least, that I've found relating to how much of the drug gets into the bloodstream, how long it stays there and what it does there: ""Despite the similar visual outcome in many of the head-to-head comparative trials of bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept in wet AMD, there are significant differences in the molecular structure of these agents, resulting in very different PK [pharmacokinetic] profiles, such as systemic exposure after intravitreal injection.""

This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, emphysema, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin. Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma). If you have any changes or growths on your skin, tell your doctor right away. While you are being treated with infliximab-abda, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccines should not be given with infliximab-abda . Your child's vaccinations must be current before using infliximab-abda. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this. Women: If you have a baby while receiving infliximab-abda, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you were using this medicine. You will need to wait a few months before giving certain vaccines to your baby. Talk to the baby's doctor if you have questions. You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test. It is important to have your heart checked closely if you receive infliximab-abda. Call your doctor right away if you have shortness of breath, swelling in the ankles and feet, or a sudden weight gain. Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes abatacept (OrenciaÂ®), anakinra (KineretÂ®), tocilizumab (ActemraÂ®), or other medicines called biologics that are used to treat the same conditions as infliximab-abda. Using these medicines together with infliximab-abda may increase your chance of having serious unwanted effects .  Renflexis Side Effects Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur: More common  Accumulation of pus black, tarry stools blurred vision chest pain chills cough diarrhea difficulty in swallowing and breathing dizziness faintness or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position fever general feeling of discomfort or illness headache hives, itching, or rash muscle pain or stiffness pain in the joints, lower back, or side painful or difficult urination pounding in the ears puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue slow or fast heartbeat sore throat sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth stuffy or runny nose swollen glands swollen, red, tender area of the infection tightness in the chest unexplained bleeding or bruising unusual tiredness or weakness weight loss yellowing of the skin and eyes Less common Cracks in the skin at the corners of the mouth soreness or redness around the fingernails and toenails vaginal burning, itching, or discharge white patches in the mouth, throat, or on the tongue Rare Abdominal or stomach pain clay-colored stools confusion coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum dark or bloody urine difficult, fast, noisy breathing dry mouth fainting or loss of consciousness fast or irregular breathing general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness increased sweating loss of appetite nausea pain, tenderness, and swelling of the foot or leg pale skin with blue lips and fingernails pinpoint red spots on the skin severe constipation sunken eyes swollen, painful, or tender lymph glands in the armpit vomiting Incidence not known Blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin bloody nose change in mental status difficulty in speaking heavier menstrual periods muscle aches and weakness new mole, change in size, shape, or color of an existing mole, or a mole that leaks fluid or bleeds numbness or tingling in the fingers, face, or feet red, irritated eyes red, scaling, or crusted skin red skin lesions often with a purple center seizures Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention.

"Iâ€™ve heard a lot of talk recently about the new oral therapy, Tecfidera, approved by the FDA last spring for multiple sclerosis. Itâ€™s the third oral drug aimed at treating my disease. In one of the many articles announcing the news, the  New York Times wrote : â€œWhile self-injected medicines like Avonex from Biogen and Copaxone from Teva that entered the market in the 1990s are still used by the majority of treated patients, newer oral drugs are making inroads. In addition to Tecfidera, the other two oral drugs are Gilenya from Novartis, approved in 2010, and Aubagio from Sanofi, approved in September.â€ Iâ€™m still on my injection therapy, Copaxone, but I consider this new drug to be great progress for the MS world. I think back to 1994  when I was diagnosed ; at the time there was only one therapy available. One! I was on Betaseron for over two years before switching to the new Avonex because a once-a-week injection sounded much more appealing than an every-other-day injection. But I suffered from horrible side effects while on both therapies. I felt like I had the flu 24/7, making it difficult to work full time and take care of my baby boy as a  single mother . When  Copaxone hit the market in 1999, I was eager to try it. Iâ€™d done my research and knew the side-effect profile was much different from the therapies Iâ€™d been struggling with for five years. It is a daily injection, which I know a lot of people have a hard time with. But I decided that I would rather give myself a shot every day if it means my body will tolerate it without the miserable flu-like side effects. Iâ€™ve been taking my daily injection â€” or my daily dose of hope, as I like to call it â€” ever since. Iâ€™m not symptom free, but Iâ€™ll be sticking (pun intended) to my injection therapy for now. The oral therapies are new and the proof that they work as well as injection drugs isnâ€™t convincing enough for me. Not yet, anyway. I will admit that taking a pill once or twice a day sounds like a nice change from what Iâ€™ve been doing for more than 14 years. But as the saying goes, â€œif itâ€™s not broken, donâ€™t fix it.â€ As an MS patient advocate, I have the opportunity to speak to many others who share my disease. A lot of these patients are newly diagnosed and have no idea which therapy is best for them; itâ€™s always a personal decision for the patient to make with the guidance of his or her neurologist. I encourage everyone to be on some type of therapy, no matter how long theyâ€™ve had MS and even if theyâ€™re currently symptom free. Why not do something to slow the disease down if you can? If one therapy isnâ€™t working for you, try a different one. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s so nice about how far weâ€™ve come in the past 20 years. Patients have a lot of choices now. But weâ€™re still not where we need to be because we donâ€™t have a cure. The FDA reminds us of this in its press release about the new drug Tecfidera: â€œNo drug provides a cure for multiple sclerosis so it is important to have a variety of treatment options available for patients,â€ said Russell Katz, M.D., director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDAâ€™s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. â€œMultiple sclerosis can impair movement, sensation, and thinking and have a profound impact on a personâ€™s quality of life.â€ So letâ€™s stick with a therapy that works for us and do our best to stay healthy until we can get that cure.",gilenya,2,,,
Reply posted for supersmalls. Thank you for sharing your experience. Iâ€™ve decided to start taking Entyvio and should be starting my first infusion next week. I will definitely keep an eye out for side effects. Fingers crossed I will see an improvement,entyvio,2,,,
"The past few weeks we have been discussing the various types of treatments for multiple sclerosis including injectable medications and oral medications. This week we will be discussing infusion medications. There are only four medications in this category, two of which have been approved just recently, Tysabri, Novantrone, Lemtrada and Ocrevus. Letâ€™s take a closer look at each of them.  Tysabri Tysabri is a monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent damaging immune cells from entering the bloodstream and crossing the blood brain barrier into the brain and spinal cord. It was approved by the FDA in 2004 for the use in MS. Tysabri is considered an immuno suppressant medication, and should not be used in combination with any other medications that affect the immune system. It is given via infusion once a month at a hospital, local infusion center or doctors office. Usually the infusion itself takes around an hour, then the individual must be observed for an hour afterwards to make sure there are no complications or reactions to the medication. Tysabri is usually considered when other medications have been tried and have not been successful. There is a very serious, but rare, risk of taking tysabri (and other immno suppressant medications), PML. PML (Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) is a potentially fatal brain infection that can be caused by the JC virus. If you are taking other medications that suppress your immune system, have been taking tysabri for a longer period of time (over two years), or test positive for the JC virus, your risk of getting PML increases. While taking tysabri, you will be monitored every six months via blood test for the JC virus. PML can be tricky to spot, as the symptoms are very similar to symptoms of MS. Clumsiness, vision changes, weakness on one side of the body, personality changes and problems with cognition (thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion). If you ever experience some of the symptoms and think you may have PML, it is important that you call your doctor immediately. Other side effects of tysabri can include headache, fatigue, chest/abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, depression, rash and joint pain. Tysabri can also cause liver damage which can be monitored and detected by blood tests. Just another reason to be keeping up with regular appointments and blood work. Although there are many warnings and potential side effects, many patients have reviewed this medication and called it â€œliquid goldâ€. They find it has helped with their symptoms immensely.  Novantrone Novantrone is an antineoplastic (anti-cancer) medication that is a DNA reactive agent, meaning it causes damage to DNA. It was approved by the FDA in 2000 for the use in MS. Novantrone works by stopping the proliferation of B cells and T cells and macrophages, which all play a role in the immune response that is thought to be involved in MS. It is indicated for people with secondary progressive MS, progressive relapsing MS or worsening relapsing remitting MS. Novantrone is given via infusion that takes 5-15 minutes. Due to potential damage to your heart, you shouldnâ€™t take more than 140mg in your lifetime, this will limit your treatment to 2-3 years. Before starting to take Novantrone, youâ€™ll have a heart test that will look for a problem called â€œleft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)â€. If you have a clinically significant reduction or a 50% reduction in LVEF, you should not take Novantrone. Also, if your neutrophill count is below 1500 cells/mm you shouldnâ€™t take it. Novantrone will clear more slowly from your body if your liver function is impaired, as well. Therefore you will need to be tested for proper liver function prior to starting Novantrone. Common side effects from Novantrone can include nausea, temporary hair thinning, temporary blue-green urine, urinary tract and airway infections, uneven heart rate, weight gain and chest pain/tightness. More serious side effects can include heart disease, liver damage and therapy-related acute leukemia (TRAL).  Lemtrada Lemtrada is a monoclonal antibody that focuses on CD52 (a protein on the surface of immune cells) and causes depletion of lymphocytes. It was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the use in MS. Originally, it was used and approved at a much higher dose for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Itâ€™s ability to target immune cells lead scientist to test its potential as a treatment for MS. Lemtrada is given by infusion for five consecutive days at first, then three consecutive days a year later. There are serious side effects associated with Lemtrada. A rare bleeding condition, a rare kidney condition, life-threatening infusion reactions, increased risk of cancers and autoimmune thyroid disorders. Yikes!! More common and less severe side effects include rash, headache, fever, nasal congestion, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, hives, itching, thyroid gland disorders, fungal infection, pain in joints, extremities and back, diarrhea, sinusitis, sore mouth and throat, tingling, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing and vomiting. Prior to starting the medication, an individual should be vaccinated for varicella, their thyroid function should be tested and then monitored every three months, they should receive a full CBC and urinalysis once a month until 48 months after last infusion and they should have a skin exam yearly to monitor for melanoma.  Ocrevus Ocrevus is the newest medication on the scene. It was approved by the FDA in early 2017 for the use in primary progressive MS, and is the first medication to be approved for primary progressive MS. Ocrevus is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 positive B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes contribute to nerve damage in MS. Ocrevus is given via infusion in a infusion center or doctors office. The initial dose is split up over two weeks. In the first infusion 300 mg is infused then two weeks later another 300 mg. Each of these infusions takes at least 2 1/2 hours. After the first two doses, you will get one infusion every six months which will take at least 3 1/2 hours. Prior to your first dose you will need to be screened for hepatitis B. As with the other medications, there are many potential side effects. Fatigue, coughing, fever, shortness of breath, nausea, headache or all possible. Infusion related reactions may occur as well. These may include throat irritation, headache, flushing, mild fever or rash. During clinical trials several individuals developed abnormal growths of tissue, the links between these growths and the medication are still not known. It is clear that these medications are very strong. Many of them include the caveat of â€œtry others firstâ€. When deciding on one of these medications, it is a very individual decision. You can talk to as many people as you want, but in the end, how the medication will affect you comes down to your body and your biology. Youâ€™ll never truly know how something will work, or not work, until you try it. Iâ€™ve been on tysabri for just over two years. Before starting the medication I read numerous patient reviews. It seemed like one person loved it then the next hated it and this continued for pages and pages. I finally realize that I just needed to try it for myself. When I first started it, after I would have an infusion I would be exhausted, like spend the rest of the day on the couch and do nothing exhausted. As the infusions went on, the exhaustion lessened. Eventually I got to the point where I am now. I can walk into the infusion center get my infusion and then go on with my day, *almost* like nothing happened.",ocrevus,2,,,

"Hello all, I have had Crohn's for several years and started taking Remicade in 2014. Before taking it, the TB skin test had come out positive, but the GI went ahead with it since the chest X-ray was clear. I have had a pneumonia infection once and another bout of shingles due to a suppressed immune system. But, the medicine has worked for my Crohn's. In the past month, I had noticed a slight swelling in the neck and the doc suggested a CT scan to rule out lymphoma. The scans showed that I had a few swollen lymph nodes and the doc advised a removal of the lymph node to do a biopsy. Luckily, it came back negative for lymphoma, but it was sent for further analysis. A few weeks later, I received a diagnosis that it was mycobacterium tuberculosis. Apparently, it had been dormant and was reactivated due to the suppressed immune system. Has anyone gone through a TB treatment after Remicade? Any help or advice is appreciated.

"MS has long been characterized as a disease of the brainâ€™s white matter, where immune cells destroy myelin. This demyelination was believed to be responsible for neuronal death, which leads to irreversible disability in individuals with MS. However, for the first time, a team of researchers have identified a subtype of the disease (MCMS), which features neuronal loss but no demyelination of the brainâ€™s white matter. In the study , which was published in Lancet Neurology , the researchers observed that in MCMS, part of the neurons become swollen and look like typical MS lesions indicative of white matter myelin loss on MRI. The teamâ€™s findings support the concept that neurodegeneration and demyelination can occur independently in MS and underscore the need for more sensitive MRI imaging techniques for evaluating brain pathology in real time and monitoring treatment response in patients with the disease. â€œThis study opens up a new arena in MS research. It is the first to provide pathological evidence that neuronal degeneration can occur without white matter myelin loss in the brains of patients with the disease,â€ commented Bruce Trapp (Cleveland Clinic), lead investigator of the study. â€œThis information highlights the need for combination therapies to stop disability progression in MS.â€ Within the study, the researchers removed brains and spinal cords at autopsy from 100 individuals who had died with MS. According to the study, visual examinations of cerebral hemisphere slices were then carried out to identify brains without areas of cerebral white-matter discoloration that were indicative of demyelinated lesions (referred to as MCMS), and brains that had cerebral white-matter discolorations or demyelinated lesions (referred to as typical MS). Their observations revealed that 12 brains did not have white matter demyelination. The researchers also compared microscopic tissue characteristics from the brains and spinal cords of individuals with MCMS (12), traditional MS (12) and also individuals without neurological disease. Although both MCMS and traditional MS patients had typical MS lesions in the spinal cord and cerebral cortex, only the latter group had MS lesions in the brain white matter. Despite this, MCMS brains did have reduced neuronal density and cortical thickness, which are hallmarks of brain degeneration also observed in traditional MS. â€œThe importance of this research is twofold. The identification of this new MS subtype highlights the need to develop more sensitive strategies for properly diagnosing and understanding the pathology of MCMS,â€ said Daniel Ontaneda (Cleveland Clinic), co-author of the study. Ontaneda concluded: â€œWe are hopeful these findings will lead to new tailored treatment strategies for patients living with different forms of MS.â€  More on multiple sclerosis: Identifying a new subtype of multiple sclerosis ( Neurodegenerative Disease Management ) Multiple sclerosis: US FDA assesses cladribine tablets as potential treatment Ask the Experts: Emerging therapies in multiple sclerosis (Part II: stem cells and future research) World Multiple Sclerosis Day â€“ a note from the Editor Sources: Trapp BD, Vignos M, Dudman J et al .

"In recent years, there have been exciting developments in treating lung cancer. Through genetic testing of tumor samples, doctors can identify specific types of lung tumors and prescribe treatments designed to target them. Immunotherapy has also emerged as a treatment option for certain types of lung cancers. These advances have made treatments more effective, often with fewer side effects.  Types of Lung Cancer There are two major types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancers and includes adenocarcinoma (the most common form of lung cancer in the United States among both men and women), squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. SCLC tumors account for the remaining 15 percent of lung cancers in the United States. They tend to grow more quickly than NSCLC tumors. Tumors are classified by stage. Stages are based on whether the cancer is local (in the lung only), locally advanced (has spread to nearby lymph nodes in the lung area) or metastatic (has spread to other parts of the body).  Treatment Options Print Email Share Tweet LUNGevity Lung Cancer Helpline Cancer  Care has partnered with LUNGevity, the nationâ€™s leading lung cancer-focused nonprofit organization to provide the LUNGevity Lung Cancer Helpline. Call  844-360-LUNG (5864).  View all of Cancer Care â€™s resources to help you better cope with lung cancer Â» Editor Heather Wakelee, MD Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford Cancer Institute  Listen Surgery Surgery, sometimes in combination with chemotherapy, is the most common treatment option for tumors confined to the lung. Advances in surgical techniques now allow doctors to make much smaller incisions to remove tumors or sections of a lung affected by cancer. Using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), the surgeon inserts a tube called a thoracoscope into the chest. This device has a light and a tiny camera connected to a video monitor.  Radiation Therapy In cases where surgery is not possible, such as in many locally advanced cancers, radiation therapy is sometimes used, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. These treatments may also be used before surgery to shrink the tumor or after surgery to help prevent the cancer from coming back (recurring). â€œExternal beamâ€ radiation is commonly used in treating lung cancer. Standard external beam radiation uses a machine that directs a beam (or multiple beams) of radiation to the tumor. The use of CT (computerized tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and PET (positron emission tomography) scans allows radiation oncologists to accurately target tumors, shaping the radiation beams to the size and dimensions of the tumor to help spare healthy tissues. A newer form of radiation called SBRT (stereotactic radiation) or stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) is sometimes used in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer instead of surgery. SBRT delivers higher doses of radiation over a shorter period of time; this approach minimizes the impact on healthy tissue. In patients at high risk from surgery, SBRT has been shown to be curative at rates that are close to expected rates with surgery. Ongoing research is trying to determine which patients could be this type of focused radiation instead of surgery.  Chemotherapy Chemotherapy has long been an effective treatment for lung cancer, and continues to be one of the most important elements of treatment for many patients. Chemotherapy is extremely effective in treating SCLC, and is also used to treat most NSCLCs. Chemotherapy can be helpful for patients with early stage cancers that have been or will be removed with surgery, and in combination with radiation for locally advanced cancer. It is also an important part of treatment for most patients with advanced stage lung cancer. Chemotherapy drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung cancer include: â€¢ Cisplatin (Platinol) and Carboplatin (Paraplatin). These are the most common medications used in treating lung cancer. Most treatment approaches include either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with another chemotherapy drug. â€¢ Pemetrexed (Alimta). Pemetrexed is used in combination with the chemotherapy cisplatin for the initial treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Pemetrexed also is approved for use alone to treat advanced non-squamous NSCLC after another chemotherapy has been given. Pemetrexed is only used for adenocarcinoma of the lung and is not active for squamous cell lung cancer or for small cell lung cancer. â€¢ Gemcitabine (Gemzar and others). These drugs are used to treat NSCLC, either in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin as an initial treatment, or as a single drug after other chemotherapy has been given. This drug works for all types of NSCLC. â€¢ Paclitaxel (Taxol), nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), docetaxel (Taxotere). These drugs are forms of â€œtaxaneâ€ chemotherapy and can be given in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin for all NSCLC. Docetaxel is frequently given alone as a later line of therapy in advanced stage lung cancer. â€¢ Etoposide (Etopophos, Vepesid). Etoposide is used in combination with other cancer medications for the treatment of SCLC.  Targeted Treatments To destroy cancer cells, targeted therapy focuses on specific cell mechanisms thought to be important for the growth and survival of tumors. These medications cause different, often less severe side effects than chemotherapy. Researchers have discovered that mutations in a gene called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can cause the development, growth and spread of lung cancer. Approximately ten percent of people with lung cancer have EGFR mutations present in their tumors. EGFR inhibitors â€“ targeted therapy given in pill form â€“ are often used to treat this type of lung cancer. Today, four medications are approved treatment options in the United States for lung cancer patients with this gene mutation: â€¢ Erlotinib (Tarceva and others). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved the use of erlotinib for lung cancer in 2004. In 2013, erlotinib was approved as an initial treatment for patients with NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body and has certain types of EGFR mutations or has a piece missing (called a â€œdeletionâ€) from the EGFR gene. â€¢ Afatinib (Gilotrif). In 2013, the FDA approved afatinib for the initial treatment of metastatic NSCLC in patients with the same EGFR gene mutations or deletions as those who can be treated successfully with erlotinib. â€¢ Gefitinib (Iressa). In July 2015, the FDA approved gefitinib for the initial treatment of patients with NSCLC whose tumors harbor specific types of EGFR gene mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test. â€¢ Osimertinib (Tagrisso). In November 2016, the FDA approved osimertinib for the treatment of patients with NSCLC whose tumors have specific EGFR gene mutations and have started to regrow after treatment with erlotinib, afatinib, or gefitinib. If resistance develops to one of drugs, and the tumor starts to grow again, a newer EGFR-inhibitor drug called osimertinib (Tagrisso) often works to shrink the cancer, or stop it from growing. Another gene mutation found in some lung cancers is referred to as ALK. Four targeted treatments are FDA-approved options for people whose cancer has this mutation: â€¢ Crizotinib (Xalkori). This treatment was approved by the FDA in 2013 for treating metastatic NSCLC tumors with the ALK gene mutation. Crizotinib blocks the mutated ALK gene, stopping the growth of the tumor. In clinical trials, it was found to be more effective than chemotherapy. Additionally, crizotinib was approved in 2016 to treat people with metastatic NSCLC tumors that have a mutation of the ROS-1 gene. â€¢ Ceritinib (Zykadia). This medication was approved in 2014 for people with metastatic ALK-positive lung cancer who cannot tolerate crizotinib or whose cancer continued to grow while being treated with crizotinib. In 2017, it was approved for newly diagnosed patients with ALK- positive lung cancer. â€¢ Alectinib (Alcensa). Alectinib was approved in December 2015 for patients with lung cancer who had already been treated with crizotinib. As a result of a large clinical trial, in November 2017 alectinib was approved to be given as a first-line treatment choice (before any prior treatment. â€¢ Brigatinib (Alunbrig). In April, 2017, brigatinib was approved for patients who had already been treated with crizotinib. In June 2017, the FDA approved the targeted therapies dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in combination, for patients with NSCLC that has a mutation of the BRAF V600E gene as detected by FDA-approved test. There are other gene mutations seen in NSCLC for which targeted therapy options may be available. As most gene mutations tend to be more common in the adenocarcinoma type of NSCLC, it is important that patients with adenocarcinoma discuss the value of genetic testing with their oncologist. Because the genes of cancer cells can evolve, some tumors may become resistant to a targeted therapy treatment. Medications to meet those challenges are being studied in clinical trials.  Cutting Off the Blood Supply to Tumors Another approach to destroying cancer cells is changing the blood supply that tumors need to grow. Blood vessels grow in several ways, but the process depends on the presence of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that can be produced both by both tumors and normal cells. This substance can stimulate blood vessels to penetrate tumors and supply them with oxygen, minerals, and other nutrients, which feeds their growth. Bevacizumab (Avastin) , a monoclonal antibody, works by stopping VEGF from stimulating the growth of new blood vessels. When combined with chemotherapy, bevacizumab has been shown to be more likely to shrink tumors and to help some patients with certain types of NSCLCâ€”such as adenocarcinomaâ€”to live longer. Ramucirumab (Cyramza) can also be used to treat NSCLC. A monoclonal antibody, it targets VEGF receptors to help stop the formation of new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is most often given with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel as a later line of therapy, after another treatment stops working.  Immunotherapy Our immune system is constantly working to keep us healthy. It recognizes and fights against danger, such as infections, viruses, and growing cancer cells. In general terms, immunotherapy uses our own immune system as a treatment against cancer. In March 2015, the FDA approved the immunotherapy nivolumab (Opdivo) for the treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC that was unsuccessfully treated with chemotherapy. Nivolumab works by interfering with a molecular â€œbrakeâ€ known as PD-1 that prevents the bodyâ€™s immune system from attacking tumors. Two additional drugs in the same category were approved in October 2016: atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda). Pembrolizumab is the only drug in this category approved for the first-line (initial) treatment of lung cancer. In February 2018, the FDA approved the immunotherapy durvalumab (Imfinzi) for the treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC whose tumors are unable to be surgically removed, and whose cancer has not progressed after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.  Treatment Approaches Being Studied The effectiveness of combining immunotherapies in the treatment of NSCLC is being studied in many clinical trials. One promising approach is pairing nivolumab with ipilimumab (Yervoy), an immunotherapy currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Another area of ongoing research is the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment option. In 2017, the FDA approved the use of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the effectiveness and potential side effects of adding radiation therapy to immunotherapy is currently being studied.  Introduction Managing Treatment Side Effects Print Email Share Tweet The Importance of Clinical Trials Clinical trials are the standard by which we measure the worth of new treatments and the quality of life of patients as they receive those treatments. For this reason, doctors and researchers urge people with cancer to take part in clinical trials. Your doctor can guide you in making a decision about whether a clinical trial is right for you. Here are a few things that you should know:  Often, people who take part in clinical trials gain access to and benefit from new treatments. Before you participate in a clinical trial, you will be fully informed as to the risks and benefits of the trial, including any possible side effects. Most clinical trials are designed to test a new treatment against a standard treatment to find out whether the new treatment has any added benefit. You can stop taking part in a clinical trial at any time for any reason. Listen All cancer treatments can cause side effects. Itâ€™s important that you report any side effects that you experience to your health care team so they can help you manage them. Report them right awayâ€”donâ€™t wait for your next appointment. Doing so will improve your quality of life and allow you to stick with your treatment plan. Itâ€™s important to remember that not all patients experience all side effects, and patients may experience side effects not listed here.  Side Effects of Chemotherapy The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the type and dose of drugs given and the length of time they are used, and can include: Fatigue (being more tired) Hair loss Diarrhea or constipation Increased risk of infection (from having too few white blood cells) Easy bruising or bleeding Changes in memory or thinking Peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in hands and feet)  Side Effects of Radiation Therapy Treatments Changes to the skin can include dryness, swelling, peeling, redness, and blistering. If a reaction occurs, contact your health care team so the appropriate treatment can be prescribed. Itâ€™s especially important to contact your health care team if there is any open skin or painful areas, as this could indicate an infection. Infections can be treated with an oral antibiotic or topical antibiotic cream.  Side Effects of Targeted Therapy Targeted therapy drugs donâ€™t have the same effect on the body as do chemotherapy drugs, but they can still cause side effects. Some of the potential side effects of targeted therapy include rashes, diarrhea, liver problems (such as elevated liver enzymes), problems with blood clotting and wound healing, and high blood pressure.  Side Effects of Immunotherapy Immunotherapy travels through the bloodstream, helping to prompt an immune response. Because it can trigger an attack on healthy cells as well as cancer cells, certain side effects may be experienced, including fatigue, decreased appetite, and digestive tract symptoms. The management of these potential side effects is discussed later in the next section of this booklet.  Managing Digestive Tract Symptoms Nausea and vomiting Avoid food with strong odors, as well as overly sweet, greasy, fried, or highly seasoned food. Nibble on dry crackers or toast. These bland foods are easy on the stomach. Having something in your stomach when you take medication may help ease nausea. Many effective medications for nausea and vomiting have been developed in recent years; talk to your doctor about whether any may be right for you.  Diarrhea Drink plenty of water. Ask your doctor about using drinks such as Gatorade which provide electrolytes as well as liquid. Electrolytes are body salts that must stay in balance for cells to work properly. Over-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium A-D and others) and prescription drugs are available for diarrhea but should be used only if necessary. If the diarrhea is bad enough that you need medicine, discuss it with your doctor or nurse. Choose foods that contain soluble fiberâ€”for example beans, oat cereals, oranges, and flaxseeds. High-pectin foods such as peaches, apples, oranges, grapefruit, bananas, and apricots can also help to avoid diarrhea.  Loss of Appetite To help maintain your weight, eat small meals throughout the day. Thatâ€™s an easy way to take in more protein and calories. Try to include protein in every meal. To keep from feeling full early, avoid liquids with meals or take only small sips (unless you need liquids to help swallow). Drink most of your liquids between meals and focus on liquids that have nutritional value. Be as physically active as you can. Sometimes, taking a short walk an hour or so before meals can help you feel hungry. Keep high-calorie, high-protein snacks on hand such as hard-boiled eggs, peanut butter, cheese, ice cream, granola bars, liquid nutritional supplements, puddings, nuts, canned tuna, or trail mix. If you are struggling to maintain your appetite, talk to your health care team about whether appetite-building medication could be right for you.  Managing Fatigue Fatigue (extreme tiredness not helped by sleep) is one of the most common side effects of many cancer treatments. If you are taking a medication, your doctor may lower the dose of the drug, as long as it does not make the treatment less effective. If you are experiencing fatigue, talk to your doctor about whether taking a smaller dose is right for you. There are a number of other tips for reducing fatigue: â€¢ Take several short naps or breaks. â€¢ Take short walks or do some light exercise, if possible. â€¢ Try easier or shorter versions of the activities you enjoy. â€¢ Ask your family or friends to help you with tasks you find difficult or tiring. â€¢ Save your energy for things you find most important. There are also prescription medications that may help, such as modafinil. Your health care team can provide guidance on whether medication is the right approach for your individual circumstances.  Managing Pain There are a number of options for pain relief, including prescription and over-the-counter medications. Itâ€™s important to talk to a member of your health care team before taking any over-the counter medication, to determine if they are safe and will not interfere with your treatments.  Treatment Options Communicating With Your Health Care Team Print Email Share Tweet Listen As you manage your lung cancer, itâ€™s important to remember that you are a consumer of health care. The best way to make decisions about health care is to educate yourself about your diagnosis and the members of your health care team, including nurses, social workers and patient navigators.  Here are some tips for improving communication with your health care team: Start a health care journal. Having a health care journal or notebook will allow you to keep all of your health information in one place. You may want to write down the names and contact information of the members of your health care team, as well as any questions for your doctor. Keep a diary of your daily experiences with cancer and treatment. You can separate your journal or notebook into different sections to help keep it organized. Prepare a list of questions. Before your next medical appointment, write down your questions and concerns. Because your doctor may have limited time, you should ask your most important questions first, and be as specific and brief as possible. Bring someone with you to your appointments. Even if you have a journal and a prepared list of questions or concerns, itâ€™s always helpful to have support when you go to your appointments. The person who accompanies you can serve as a second set of ears. He or she may also think of questions to ask your doctor or remember details about your symptoms or treatment that you may have forgotten. Write down your doctorâ€™s answers. Taking notes will help you remember your doctorâ€™s responses, advice and instructions. If you cannot write down the answers, ask the person who accompanies you to do that for you. If you have a mobile device, you can use it to take notes. Writing notes will help you review the information later. Record your visit if your doctor allows it. Recording the conversation with your doctor gives you a chance to hear specific information again or share it with family members or friends. Incorporate other health care professionals into your team. Your oncologist and oncology nurse are essential members of your health care team, but there are other health care professionals who can help you manage your diagnosis and treatment. Make sure your oncologist knows of any other medical conditions you have, or any pain you are experiencing, so that they can consult with your primary care physician or your specialist if needed. Remember, there is no such thing as over-communication.  Managing Treatment Side Effects FAQ's Print Email Share Tweet Cancer Care â€™s Free Support Services and Programs Oncology social workers provide emotional support for people with cancer and their loved ones.

My breathing has been affected by surgery and chemotherapy. What can I do about this? A. When surgery reduces the size of the lungs, you cannot take in as much air. Some medications also change lung function and lead to shortness of breath. Any time you have difficulty breathing, you should report it to your doctor. He or she can prescribe pulmonary (lung) rehabilitation therapy. This therapy may include exercise training, energy-conserving techniques, breathing strategies, and nutritional counseling to improve lung function. Q. My lung cancer has an RET gene mutation. Are any drugs being studied for this type of tumor? A. RET proteins send signals to cells, telling them to divide, mature, and â€œspecializeâ€ (perform specific functions). When there is a mutation in the RET gene, this signal can get stuck, causing unchecked cell growth. In 2011, it was discovered that a mutation of the RET gene mutation was linked to lung cancer. Three medications have been approved by the FDA for people with other types of cancer that have the RET mutation: cabozantinib (Cometriq) and vandetanib (Caprelsa) for people with thyroid cancer, and sunitinib (Sutent) for those with kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Talk with your doctor about lung cancer clinical trials for people with the RET gene mutation and ask whether he or she recommends prescribing any of these medications to you â€œoff labelâ€ (using a prescription drug legally to treat a cancer for which the drug has not been approved by the FDA). Q. What happens if my treatment stops working? A. If that happens, you should discuss alternative treatment options with your doctor. Their recommendation will be based on your unique situation, which includes factors related to your overall health. Note that there are several drugs in late-phase clinical trials that are intended for use when the initial lung cancer treatment becomes less effective or stops working. Q. I had Stage 1A lung cancer surgically removed. My doctor says I donâ€™t need chemo or any other type of treatment. Should I get a second opinion? A. If your cancer was truly Stage 1A, treatment after surgery is not recommended. However, itâ€™s very important to get a CT scan every six months for the first two years after surgery, to check for recurrence and any new cancer. After the first two years, your doctor will recommend how frequently to get a CT scan.

"My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 NSCLC in September 2014. She is EFGR+ and T790M+.  History: She was first on Tarceva, then carboplatin/alimta plus tarceva, then tagrisso. Progression on tagrisso started in December 2016. She then tried one round of Keytruda because her PD-L1 expression was 60%. Due to extreme coughing and to rule out pneumonitis, a CT scan was done right before her second round of Keytruda. Scans show very large growth on existing tumors and new growths. The oncologist thought it would be better to switch to chemo to try to control the growth as soon as possible because immunotherapy tends to take weeks to months to be effective. By then, the cancer could have grown too much. So she had 2 rounds of docetaxol, which did nothing and the cancer continued to progress. Now she had 2 rounds on navelbine and CT scans show mixed results. Some tumors are slightly smaller but others have remained the same or grew a tiny bit. She will continue on navelbine until much clearer progression shows. But what options does my mom have after? The oncologist thought it would be worth a shot to retry tagrisso because she is still T790M positive. The oncologist thinks there is a higher chance of tagrisso working than to retry any type of immunotherapy? She said that most EGFR positive patients do not have good results on immunotherapy and that my mother was a rare case who was EGFR positive and had a high PD-L1 expression.",tarceva,2,,,
"""Also for me I spent about a year-year and half wallowing and just seemed to get worse and worse. When I finally got off my rear and did something active again I started feeling the difference almost immediately. The first couple weeks I was exhausted but as I built up strength it got better.

"Hi Jeannie, Most often, patients begin at the standard dosage, mostly because clinical trials have shown that dose to be tolerated by most patients, and that the specified dosage has shown efficacy. Once that â€œmaximum tolerated doseâ€ has been established in early-phase clinical trials, lower dosages donâ€™t tend to be tested. But oncology is as much an art as a science, so there is certainly room for individualization. If the oncologist feels that a lower dose would minimize side effects for a particular patient, then that dose can be recommended. Unless the cancer appears to be progressing at a very fast rate, it is reasonable to start low and raise the dose if the drug is well-tolerated but the response is less than anticipated, although that can be  a tough determination, since each patient can achieve a different level of response, and with Stage IV disease, even stability without tumor shrinkage is a good result. As far as side effects if a larger dose is taken less frequently, that doesnâ€™t tend to be well studied either, but a number of patients who have been given â€œpulsedâ€ Tarceva (e.g., 600 mg every four days) do not seem to experience more significant side effects than those who receive 150 mg per day.

"Hi Kempten, I think the initial question would be: how slight is the progression in the lung mass compared to itâ€™s overall size? Has there been any thought to continuing Tagrisso for a bit to confirm progression and determine the rate of growth? Dr. West has often stated that it often makes sense to stay with a well-tolerated treatment even in the face of slow progression, as â€œbad brakes are better than no brakes.â€ Of course your local doctors are best able to judge that question. If the original percentage of exon 19 mutation is unchanged, that seems to indicate that it is not only the exon 19-positive portion of the cancer which is progressing, since you would expect the percentage to rise. Either way itâ€™s just speculation, since unfortunately we donâ€™t understand resistance and progression all that well yet.   There has been some discussion of treating with Tarceva after the failure of Tagrisso, but thatâ€™s after using Tagrisso in a first-line setting. Even in that context, there isnâ€™t good evidence yet for its efficacy, as Dr. Ramalingam stated just two months ago: â€œTagrisso is being studied in the first line therapy setting to see if shutting down the T790 escape (resistance) mechanism pro-actively will improve the outcome for patients. The approach has shown promising early results and are now being studied in a large clinical trial. This trial compares tagrisso directly with tarceva or iressa. We are still learning about what mechanisms of resistance are observed when patients are treated with tagrisso in the first line setting. It is possible that for a subset of these patients, using iressa or tarceva after they have received tagrisso might be beneficial, but it is too early at this time to make firm statements on this issue.The presently available data are based on laboratory experiments and have not been confirmed in patientsâ€ â€“ http://cancergrace.org/topic/tagrisso-first-line-and-then-tarceva-therapy#post-1288425 [continued}   Jul 2008 Wife Liz (51/never smoker) Dx Stage IV NSCLC EGFR exon 19 4 cycles Carbo/alimta, 65% shrinkage Tarceva maintenance Mar 2010 progression, added Alimta, stable Sep 2010 multiple brain mets, WBR Oct 2010 large pericardial effusion, tamponade Jan 2011 progression, start abraxane Jun 2011-New liver, brain mets, add Tarceva Oct 2011-Dx Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; pulsed Tarceva At rest Nov 4 2011 Since then: http://cancergrace.org/blog/jim-and-lisa    		This reply was modified 1 year, 9 months ago by Â JimC Forum Moderator.

"Hi Bettina I am about 5 years diagnosed now, was on rebif, tysabri and then fingolimod. I came off the fingolimod in Nov 2016 in preparation to start IVF, then during jan/feb this year I had the worst 2 relapses I have ever had (slap bang in the middle of our first IVF try) MRI showed at least 7 new active lesions. Neuro really wanted me to stop ivf and go straight for Lemtrada - so leave the ivf for another 2 years, I didnt want to. At one point during that appointment he got so frustrated with me he threw his hands up in the air and walked out saying he would have to get someone else to make me see sense. I agreed that I would at the very least meet with my MS nurse about starting lemtrada, she was so much more understanding of our wants of a baby, but what was of more interest, she said it isnt unheard of for women to have a baby in between the lemtrada treatments. I understand what you are saying about feeling selfish about wanting a baby before you are ""well"" - I have always had pretty bad relapses but then, luckily, recovered very well. My husband also has MS - so it as a huge decision to come off treatment for the IVF. Despite those 2 relapses I had - I am so happy I stuck to my guns and did what I wanted to do. I am older than you (33) and already much older than i wanted to be when I started a family so there was no way i was waiting another 2 years. Pregnancy can be kind to MS, breast feeding once you deliver also offers some protection against relapse. We were lucky enough that our 2nd round of IVF worked and I am due late Jan 2017. My neuro wants me to start Lemtrada within 2 weeks of delivery, I havent decided on that yet, I cant imagine I would want to leave a newborn for 5 days (even though I can come home at night) that soon. MS throws us so many many curve balls, its great to hear what other people did or didnt do, but I honestly believe you should go with your gut. You will always find someone who disagrees with your decision. I cant tell you how many times I/we were called selfish for trying for a baby when we both have MS - didnt stop us. Good luck with your decision, I will be really interested how you get on whichever way you choose to go, if you dont mind sharing of course! Hayey xx",fingolimod,1,,,

"Long-term treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) appears to lessen the risk of disease worsening in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) patients, an 18-year follow-up study suggests. But these therapies were not seen to benefit those who had progressed to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ). The study, â€œ Onset of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis is not influenced by current relapsing multiple sclerosis therapies, â€ was published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal â€“ Experimental, Translational and Clinical . Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are treatments that aim to reduce MS progression from relapsingâ€“remitting forms of the disease to SPMS. Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,709 patients registered at the Group for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (GITEM) Registry in Valencia, Spain. Out of the initial 1,709 patients, 225 were clinically diagnosed with MS and 204 received treatment with first-line DMTs â€” interferon beta ( Biogen â€˜s Avonex , among other brand names) or glatiramer acetate (sold as Teva â€˜s Copaxone ). Treatment with DMTs began when patients experienced at least one relapse in the previous year or two relapses within the previous three years. RRMS patients were followed for a median of 18.1 years. Patients who failed to respond to treatment were given second-line therapies, namely the immune suppressants Novantrone (mitoxantrone), cyclophosphamide, or selective second-line DMTs, such as Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) . Study participants were evaluated regularly â€” every three to six months â€” for changes in their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores , relapse rates, and for side effects or decisions to stop treatment. Progression to SPMS was confirmed â€œwhen patients with a previous EDSS score of 3.0 or greater experienced a six-month worsening to EDSS 4.0 or greater without evidence of relapse,â€ the researchers wrote.

"Hi I have been following your site since April 2014 when I was diagnosed with RRMS after what I thought was a stroke. I'm a 32yo female. Since that time, I have had several relapses and tried a few different meds which didn't agree with me (with the second one leaving me bed ridden for a week). My last relapse was in June. I developed severe vertigo (which I still haven't fully recovered from) and complete numbness down my right side and had to go into hospital for IV steroids after I refused to take them orally again. On the plus side that led me to start fingolimod which I have found gives me no issues. I am on a number of symptomatic meds..some work, some don't. Mobility comes and goes and I've had to reduce my hours at work as I kept falling asleep at home suddenly and no one could wake me until I was ready to come out of it. I have a really good doctor and ms nurse who I can contact at any time. I'm not one to tell people what's going on or complain if I experience something different and will only really say something if they ask. My biggest issue and annoyance at the moment (in addition with having to deal with the random other stuff) currently is constipation with the odd accident (like at a bus stop, just before getting on the bus) and bladder issues. I go from not being able to pass urine to just utterly wetting myself (most recently on New Year's Eve in front of my mother) The urologists want me to self catherise, which I can't bring myself to do. It's always nice to read that people just deal what is dealt to them on a regular basis and just try to get on with it. And that I'm not the only one who gets the most random symptoms and how you deal with them x",fingolimod,0,,,

"My mother has been on prednisone for almost four years for polumyalgia/rheumatica.

"I'm currently on Gilenya and I've been pretty much relapse free since I started taking it seven years ago. The only drugs recommended for SPMS are interferon beta and mitoxantrone, and they're only for people who are still relapsing.

If hanging on to the relapsing-remitting label keeps me on a drug I'm happy with, I'll let the neurologist use the label regardless of how I feel about my condition. As for appointments, I think you have to see a neurologist once a year if you're taking prescribed medication.

"Hi vender   The way I understand it, all MS is basically the same as it involves the demyelination and neurodegeneration of nerves in the brain and/or spinal cord.

PRMS now falls under active PPMS with relapses. I have PPMS and do not take any DMD's because of no relapses (acute inflammatory events).

"Hi Molly  @molope , and â€œYes Maâ€™amâ€ Iâ€™ve had experience with LASER eye treatment for retinopathy, plenty of treatments. So many treatments that Iâ€™ve lost count, probably more than 100, and with several variations of LASER. I was diagnosed with Retinopathy at Joslin Clinic in 1966 and was â€œassuredâ€ that Iâ€™d be totally blind within two years and was then referred to an ophthalmologist in Boston who confirmed the diagnosis and my prognosis and then told me about a treatment theory on which he was working - LASER photocoagulation and I volunteered as guinea pig. â€œMYâ€ first LASER treatment in 1967 was a modified weapons grade â€œrubyâ€ that had a fixed strength and duration - I returned every other month for more burns for a few years - there is a video of me on the Joslin site laying on the operating table [in shirt and tie] during one of my follow-up treatments in summer of 1968. My latest LASER treatment was December 2016 with a green-argon. As far as pain or discomfort, Iâ€™ve never had much and Iâ€™ve found that the location of the burn makes a big difference - the Ruby LASER was the least painful for me. The times that Iâ€™ve felt a brief, short â€œpainâ€ has been when the doctor needed to aim close to the nerve with a high power; I doubt that this will be required in your case. Because of the thousands of burns that Iâ€™ve had I donâ€™t have any real estate available for future treatments. If I found myself in your place and trusted the opinion and skill of the doctor, I would agree to the treatment. My decision 52 years ago has awarded me with many years of good vision and life. Before I agreed in 1966, I had to research because I had never heard of LASER. I sot out advice from other doctors and from scientists including in NASA - turns out one of my relatives who was in charge of Apollo space mission was using a ruby LASER to mark landing sites on the moon.

"The dosing schedule sounds similar to what my wife's current trial is attempting to do with Irinotecan, Erbitux, with or without Avastin (or placebo). They dropped the 5-FU from the previous FOLFIRI and added Erbitux. She thinks she is still getting the Avastin based on previous experience with it (She is still on the ACE inhibitor they use with Avastin use though her BP is usually low to begin with). She has only the infusion on Mondays, then nothing again until day 14 when she gets hit again. Problem is I don't know if they are using a higher dosage of Erbitux or not. She is tolerating this very well and the rash came on after a week, not right away, but she thinks it was subsiding prior to yesterdays infusion (which was #2). I am of course interested in the UCSD trial as I contributed research to these class of drugs - particularly CI-1033, and Dacomitinib. I still believe despite the failure of Dacomitinib against Erlotinib in the big Pfizer NSCLC trial (ARCHER 1009) that Dacomitinib is still a superior EGFR family inhibitor. The UCSD trial looks promising. We know that EGFr inhibitors once they become resistant, that if one lays off them for a while the pathway that was diverted and make the tumors resistant will revert and EGFr inhibitors become effective again. So I wonder also if this dosing schedule and concentration used in the trial isn't working similarly. Hitting the tumor hard, relaxing, and not enabling the tumor to slide into the alternative signaling pathway. Many questions that hopefully this trial will answer.

"Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in combination with pemetrexed (Alimta) and platinum as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic, nonsquamous nonâ€“small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Pembrolizumab was previously granted accelerated approval for this indication in May 2017 based on improvements in overall response rate and progression-free survival for patients randomized to pembrolizumab administered with pemetrexed and carboplatin as compared with pemetrexed and carboplatin alone in the KEYNOTE-021 study. KEYNOTE-189 This most recent approval represents fulfillment of a postmarketing commitment demonstrating the clinical benefit of this product. This action is based on the results of KEYNOTE-189 , a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active controlled study enrolling 616 patients receiving first-line treatment for metastatic, nonsquamous NSCLC. In KEYNOTE-189, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive pembrolizumab (or placebo) in combination with pemetrexed, and investigatorâ€™s choice of either cisplatin or carboplatin every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab (or placebo) and pemetrexed. Treatment with pembrolizumab continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. The primary efficacy outcome measures were overall survival and progression-free survival as assessed by a blinded independent committee review (using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1). Key Results The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for patients randomized to pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38â€“0.64; P < .00001) in a prespecified interim analysis. Median overall survival was not reached at the time of the data cutoff in the pembrolizumab-plus-chemotherapy arm and was 11.3 months for those in the chemotherapy arm. The trial also demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival for patients randomized to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (HR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.43â€“0.64; P < .00001). The median progression-free survival was 8.8 months for patients receiving pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and 4.9 months for those receiving chemotherapy alone. The overall response rate was significantly higher (48% vs 19%; P = .0001) for those in the pembrolizumab-plus-chemotherapy arm. The median response duration was 11.2 months and 7.8 months, respectively. The most common adverse reactions reported in â‰¥ 20% of patients in KEYNOTE-189 were fatigue/asthenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, and pyrexia. The recommended pembrolizumab dose and schedule for nonsquamous NSCLC is 200 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. This is the second FDA approval using the Real Time Oncology Review pilot program that enabled the FDA review team to begin analyzing data before the application submission.

"Reply posted for cianphillips. Hi Jamie, I know you are looking for confirmation. Unfortunately, I was diagnosed in 2000 and didn't eat any microwave processed foods for the following 15 years. During that time I was on steroids, which worked the first time, then, during the next flare, didn't work even at 50Mg a day. My symptoms finally improved when I had ramped down to 10Mg per day. I was on a naturapathic, alergen free, liquid diet, which didn't work. I took a bunch of Chinese herbs and enteric coated peppermint, which worked, and then it didn't. Then Azacol, which never worked, even at the highest doses. Mercapterpurine (6mp) and that worked for a couple of years, then my liver enzyme tests started coming back in the dangerous range so I had to stop them. Most recently, I've been on Remicade, which worked for a year or so, then, stopped. My current flare (while on Remicade) can't be treated with steroids (they now make me super sugar sensitive - requiring insulin injections etc). I take handfuls of pro and prebiotics every day, eat sour krout and pickles with live cultures, unsweetened goat kefir, garlic, fish oils, as much as I can tolerate them. There have been years that I stayed away from all milk, nuts, black and red pepper etc. thinking they were the culprits followed by years of eating them without incident. (Except spicy foods which still hurt pretty consistently) All of this is to say that I am convinced that (for me) most treatments, diet contraints and additions, offer minimal benefit, sometimes enough to assist in remission, but none have been consistent. As mentioned by a previous poster regarding one of many treatments 26% in the untreated placebo group improved, and 47% respond to the treatment. If my math is right (and it may not be - feel free to correct me) it's possible that 26% of the 47% of positive outcomes could have been spontaneous (e.g., placebo) which leaves a 21% higher than placebo efficacy for the treatment. (this surprised me, and I haven't fact checked) but those numbers mirror my experiences with treatments of all kinds. In my experience I have made correlative connections between many diet changes and medications that in the long run have not turned out to be causative.",remicade,1,,,
"â€œIn a review of the literature, we found that, to date, pembrolizumab has been the only PD-1 or PD-LI inhibitor to show a significant survival benefit over chemotherapy when given as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy for metastatic, squamous, or nonsquamous NSCLC [non-small cell lung cancer] .â€ 1 That statement is from researchers writing in The New England Journal of Medicine , who also presented new data at the IASLC's 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto, Canada, on September 25, 2018. Based on their data, Merck Sharp & Dohme, the maker of pembrolizumab, can now add that treatment with pembrolizumab, in combination with chemotherapy, resulted in significantly longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy alone in squamous NSCLC. According to the article, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rate of survival at 1 year were 65.2% in the pembrolizumab-combination arm and 48.3% in the placebo-combination arm. Though the trial has not concluded (and has an estimated conclusion date of 2021), the decision to report the second interim results occurred because the â€œefficacy boundaries for the primary hypotheses of overall survival and progression-free survival had been met,â€ the investigators wrote. 1 They originally set the goalpost for interim analysis to occur after 332 events or disease progression or death occurred.  Related Articles In a Head-to-Head Battle, Brigatinib Appears to Best Crizotinib Durvalumab Shows Overall Survival Benefit in Patients With Stage III NSCLC Despite Promising Trial Results, Skeptics Raise Red Flags About Anlotinib's Efficacy in Heavily Treated NSCLC In a double-blind, phase 3 trial, researchers running the KEYNOTE-407 trial randomly assigned 559 untreated, metastatic, squamous NSCLC patients to receive either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles (278 patients and 281 patients, respectively). All patients were also treated with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle-albumin bound [nab]-paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Patients who received paclitaxel also received premedication with a glucocorticoid and antihistamines. Patients were allowed to crossover in certain circumstances; 75 patients switched from placebo to pembrolizumab after disease progression, and 14 patients received a subsequent PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor from prescribers outside of the trial. PD-L1 expression status was assessed using Agilent Technologies' PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay, and tumor imaging was scheduled for weeks 6, 12, and 18, every 9 weeks through week 45, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. As a result of the use of this tool, patients were excluded from the trial if they could not provide a tumor sample for the determination of PD-L1 status. OS, PFS, response rate, and duration of response were calculated through the use of blinded, independent central review of radiologic images. A PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 1% or greater was seen in 63.1% of patients â€” but regardless of patient PD-L1 expression level, there was an overall survival benefit observed across the pembrolizumab-combination group. In this group, median OS at follow-up was 15.9 months, compared with 11.3 months in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.85; P < .001); median PFS was 6.4 months and 4.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, .056; 95% CI, 0.45-0.70; P < .001). â€œThe risk of death was 36% lower and the risk of disease progression or death was 44% lower in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group,â€ the authors wrote. But, they added, â€œIn patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the currently available data do not permit the determination of whether pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy has greater efficacy than pembrolizumab alone.â€ 1 Response rates, however, were higher among the individuals who received the pembrolizumab-based regimen compared with the rates observed in those on the placebo regimen when the patients were placed in subgroups defined by PD-L1 tumor proportion score. And, outcomes improved across all categories of PD-L1 tumor proportion scores in the pembrolizumab/chemotherapy group, making the study authors question the usefulness of PD-L1 as a biomarker to guide drug selection. Adverse events (AEs) were similar across treatment groups, although treatment discontinuation in the pembrolizumab-combination group occurred more frequently than in the placebo-combination group (13.3% vs 6.4%, respectively). There were 23 deaths due to AEs in the pembrolizumab-based arm and 18 AE-related deaths in the placebo-based arm.

"We've arrived at the heavy hitters! Going back to the first installment of IBD Academy (""Back to Basics""), remember that inflammatory bowel disease is fundamentally an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakingly attacks the body's own tissue. To inhibit and counteract this reaction, immunomodulators and biologics are used to dampen the autoimmune response. A serious concern in using these medications is that T lymphocytes, the white blood cells at the center of autoiummunity, are widespread in the body. Targeting them induces to systematic, not local, immunosuppression, meaning that the gut isn't the only part of the body affected. Regular blood tests are usually done to check liver, kidney, and bone marrow function because of the suppressive effects that these drugs have on the immune system. Patients on immunomodulators and/or biologics are also encouraged receive yearly flu vaccines and avoid live vaccines while on these medications. Because there are so many cells and molecules involved in autoimmunity, here are some key players to familiarize yourself with and refer back to while diving into the mechanisms utilized by various immunosuppressant medications.  KEY Vocab intestinal mucosa : the tissue that lines the GI tract and is made up of endothelial cells  attacked by white blood cells in the autoimmune reaction that is the basis of IBD T lymphocyte or  T cell : a type of white blood cell central to the immune response in IBD and other autoimmune disorders  antibody : proteins that circulate in the blood following their production by the immune system in response foreign particles detected in the body  may be produced by the body or created artificially to be used as a drug cytokine : signaling proteins essential for communication between cells involved in the inflammatory response (may be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory)  interleukin : a class of cytokines involved in modulation of immune responses and the development of T lymphocytes  TNF-Î± (tumor necrosis factor alpha): a pro-inflammatory cytokine and central regulator of immune function that is the target for multiple biologic therapies for autoimmune disorders  Î±4Î²7 integrin : a receptor on T cells that allow them to interact with other cells in the body  MAdCAM-1 : a protein expressed on the endothelial cells of small blood vessels in the intestinal mucosa  Immunomodulators drugs that modulate and/or weaken the immune system in order to dampen the inflammatory response may be used in conjunction with a biologic (""dual therapy"" or ""combination therapy"") to increase the chance of inducing and maintaining remission Thiopurines  azathioprine (Imuran): oral  6-mercaptopurine (6-MP, Purinethol): oral mechanism of action: prevents the activation of T lymphocytes, which keeps them from attacking the intestinal mucosa and causing inflammation may take three months to work; therefore, patients are often on steroids until the new medication kicks in methotrexate : subcutaneous (SC) injections mechanism of action: in addition to acting at a cellular level like thiopurines, methotrexate may also inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 (interleukin-1) and TNF-Î± in the bloodstream traditionally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, it can be used in Crohn's patients who have failed or become tolerant of thiopurines hasn't been shown to be effective in UC must be used with caution in women of child-bearing age due to the risk of birth defects or miscarriage cyclosporine : oral mechanism of action: prevents T lymphocytes from producing cytokines or multiplying traditionally used to prevent rejection following an organ transplant, it can be used for patients with severe UC much more rapid onset of action than thiopurines (takes 1-2 two weeks to begin working) tacrolimus : oral or topical mechanism of action: also prevents T lymphocytes from making cytokines or multiplying traditionally used to prevent rejection following an organ transplant, it can be used for patients with severe UC or fistulizing Crohn's can be used topically for active Crohn's disease around the mouth or perianal area and on the skin for pyoderma gangrenosum  Biologics drug names end in ""mab"", which stands for monoclonal antibody  biologics are antibodies designed to bind to and inhibit inflammatory factors or other molecular targets involved in the immune response in IBD because antibodies are foreign proteins, the immune system can then produce anti-drug antibodies against the biologic itself, causing the drug to stop working many IBD patients switch to another biologic after forming antibodies against one listed below in order of FDA approval (oldest to newest) Anti-TNFs mechanism of action: bind to block excess TNF-Î± in the bloodstream in order to prevent it from attacking healthy cells in the gut (see figure below)  Remicade (infliximab): infusion every 8 weeks  FDA approved to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adults and children two biosimilars, essentially a ""generic"" are now available Renflexis (infliximab-abda) and Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) also treats rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis Humira (adalimumab): SC injection every 2 weeks  FDA approved to treat Crohn's disease in adults and children and ulcerative colitis in adults also treats juvenile and adult rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and panuveitis Cimzia (certolizumab pegol): SC injection every 2 weeks  FDA approved to treat Crohn's disease in adults also treats rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis Simponi (golimumab): SC injection every 4 weeks  FDA approved to treat ulcerative colitis in adults also treats rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis   Excess amounts of TNF-alpha cause your immune system to mistakenly attack healthy cells in the GI tract, leading to inflammationâ€”the underlying cause of Crohnâ€™s symptoms.

Based on an individuals response, the schedule may be adjusted for more frequent dosing.* No individual or class of biologics has been shown effective in treating most cases of IBD. It is currently unknown why a given patient will respond to one biologic and not another. Because the series of molecular interactions that lead to active IBD (the ""inflammatory cascade"") is a complicated web of triggers and interactions, there are many, many, potential molecular targets for new treatments. In addition to targeting pathways common to many autoimmune disorders, researchers are also attempting to develop new biologics with gut-specific mechanisms of immunosuppression, such as that of Entyvio. Medications that work this way are safer overall in that they suppress the immune system in a more local manner, making patients less susceptible to certain infections in comparison to those on older, more general immunosuppressants.    The immune response leading to intestinal inflammation in active inflammatory bowel disease consists of a variety of pro-inflammatory factors, including the cytokines TNA-Î± and interleukins, as well as the activation of multiple types of white blood cells (mainly various T cells). Each of these molecules and associated cell receptors represent potential targets for IBD therapies. The top section of this figure shows targets and associated drugs in the intestinal mucosa (anti-TNFs and anti-interleukins). The bottom section shows targets in the bordering blood vessels (anti-integrins). Image taken from Danese, S., Vuitton, L., and Peyrin-Biroulet, L. Biologic agents for IBD: practical insights.

"Sorry guys, I got a bit down at the end of my first post. I'm so over Crohn's... :-/ @mirowpl - Good luck with the Entyvio. I mean, I know my experience isn't the most encouraging one ever, but I have seen a lot of people say it got them into remission. @scifigal - Ha! Yeah, I wouldn't want my gut to be prettier than me, that's just not on <_<. I think on the whole I would still pick clinical remission, but on the other hand it would be annoying to have these symptoms with no explanation for them. If that had been the case, I would have had to start thinking about possible other causes. Think for now I can pin most things onto the Crohn's as per usual. @CM - No, you were right. Technically I had Crohn's ileocoliltis, but the vast bulk of my disease was in the colon. However my terminal ileum was affected as well, so I had that removed along with my colon - hence the 'neo', or new, terminal ileum that the report goes on about . I've tried Imuran and 6MP. I've been on 6MP for nearly a year. As far as I can tell the 6MP has done nothing except make me burn easier in the sun. I don't have good luck with meds :-( Edit: @Tom - Thanks. I'm not certain about Stelara not being available; I'd have to ask my GI about it. While the inflammation isn't as widespread as it was before, it seems to be just as stubborn and treatment-resistant. On the plus side I'm not as ill as when my entire colon was inflamed, but I don't feel entirely healthy either. I don't think you can be with your immune system attacking bits of your digestive system, thyroid, eyes, etc. Sorry I'm getting a bit down again.

"Hello folks. Thanks F27, Lab and scifigal. @Bull - I know you mean well and I certainly wouldn't disagree that I was lonely. But nobody gets admitted to a psychiatric ward just for loneliness, particularly an NHS one. I was literally suicidal and looking up plans on the Internet. I don't think you understand how withdrawn depression makes you and it's not something you can overcome with willpower. If I could have e.g. made conversation with the staff at my local cafe, like some of the other regulars did, I would have done so. As it was, by the end I was struggling even to place my order without wanting to cry. It is a bit of a vicious circle in a way. Depression makes you lonely but depression also makes it impossible to socialise. Or to gain any pleasure from it if you do. I mean, my brother had a girlfriend and friends, so he wasn't alone. But that wasn't enough to protect him from his issues or obvious lifelong tendency towards depression. At any rate, guess who still hasn't seen a doctor, folks? Yep >.> But I have been granted leave for this afternoon. A staff member told me yesterday, that as I was an informal patient i.e. Not sectioned, I basically could go out whenever I wanted to. Thought that sounded a bit too good to be true and, to my complete non surprise, it was. I desperately need more clothes and a few other things, but also I would rather like to see the market square again. It's pretty at Christmas with all the trees covered in lights. I'd rather go on my own but the guy sounded dubious about it. An occupational therapist just knocked on my door and asked if I needed anything: yes, toilet roll, desperately. I'm down to using paper towels now, which is ridiculous. I actually ran out last night and asked a nurse for more: a girl overheard me and said she could give me some. Which was really nice of her but unfortunately it wasn't nearly enough - not her fault at all. Anyway the OT mentioned something about ""standard issue"", so I let her know I had Crohn's disease, was going about 8x a day and that the standard issue wasn't nearly enough. Anyway I'm getting tired now. Would like to write about the patients some time, but that may be too long to do by phone. In the meantime I took a few photos earlier, which I will upload later.

"Now with more current data, the concept of pseudoprogression is a concern for many oncologists from the other side of the equation - waiting too long for immuno to work can be a mistake. Here's a recent article by Dr. Jack West of Cancer Grace. Different cancers have different pseudoprogression rates. In melanoma, it can be fairly significant. In lung cancer, it's between 1 and 3 percent. http://cancergrace.org/lung/2016/09/12/death-by-pseudoprogression-knowing-w hen-to-cut-your-losses-with-immunotherapy/#more-17624 Along the same thinking, here's a quote from a lung cancer presentation by Dr. Eddie Garon, in which he says, ""One other important issue to address is this issue of pseudoprogression, and this is something that people in the immunotherapy field have talked about for a long time, that if you have an effective immunotherapy, that you may have immune cells that infiltrate into the tumor and, as a result, rather than getting smaller, that the tumor would actually get larger. That could certainly happen over a short period of time, but what I would say, to date, is itâ€™s not something weâ€™ve seen a lot in lung cancer. Our colleagues in melanoma certainly report this as being a significant issue â€” patients who will have initial growth of their tumor on imaging, and then, afterwards, will have shrinking. We certainly do have several intriguing anecdotes, sort of individual patients that people will describe who have had, sort of, increases in their tumor volume, but then get better, but I would say that it is actually quite uncommon in lung cancer. So, the dilemma continues to be do we roll the dice if there's some progression and continue for a while, or move onto the next line of treatment? In my case, the first scan after two rounds of Keytruda, showed ""mixed"" results (some progression, some shrinkage, some hint of perhaps new things). Since my PD-1 expression is so high (90%) and because my performance status continues to be zero, oncologist and I decided to keep going for another three infusions and then rescan. He said, ""Conventional wisdom would tell us to move on to something else."" So, we're bucking conventional wisdom for now , with full understanding that it's a risk. Next scan will be in two weeks (after five infusions, total). Clem",keytruda,2,,,

"Brand Name(s): , Tafinlar Â®  WHY is this medicine prescribed? Dabrafenib is used alone or in combination with another medication (trametinib [Mekinist]) to treat a certain types of melanoma (a type of skin cancer) that cannot be treated with surgery or that has spread to other parts of the body. It is also used along with trametinib to treat and prevent the return of a certain type of melanoma after surgery to remove it and any affected lymph nodes. Dabrafenib is also used in combination with trametinib to treat a certain type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has spread to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body. It is also used to treat a certain type of thyroid cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body and has not responded to previous treatment(s). Dabrafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells.  Are there OTHER USES for this medicine? This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

"The FDA has granted a priority review designation to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for use in combination with carboplatin and etoposide for the frontline treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). The sBLA is based on the phase 3 IMpower133 study, in which adding Tecentriq to standard upfront carboplatin and etoposide significantly prolonged survival in patients with ES-SCLC. The FDA action date for a decision on the sBLA is March 18, 2019. After a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median overall survival (OS) in IMpower133 was 12.3 months in the Tecentriq arm compared with 10.3 months in the placebo arm â€” a 30 percent reduction in the risk of death. OS events occurred in 51.7 percent of the Tecentriq arm and 66.3 percent of the control arm. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months in the Tecentriq group compared with 4.3 months in the placebo. Tecentriq was associated with a higher six-month PFS rate (30.9 percent vs. 22.4 percent), and a more than doubling 12-month PFS rate (12.6 percent vs 5.4 percent) compared with placebo. â€œItâ€™s been more than 20 years since there has been a new initial treatment option for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer that delivers a clinically meaningful survival benefit,â€ Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development, Genentech (Roche), the manufacturer of Tecentriq, said in a statement. â€œWe are working closely with the FDA to bring this Tecentriq-based regimen to people with this difficult-to-treat type of lung cancer as soon as possible,â€ added Horning. The global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1/3 IMpower133 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line Tecentriq as adjunctive therapy to standard of care, combination carboplatin and etoposide, in 403 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with ES-SCLC. Results from the study were presented at the 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer. The results were simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine . All patients received four 21-day cycles of carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min IV on day one and 100 mg/m 2 etoposide IV on days 1 through 3. Patients were also randomized 1 to 1 to receive either concurrent Tecentriq at 1200 mg IV on day 1 (201 patients) or placebo (202 patients) during the induction phase. Treatment was followed by maintenance therapy with Tecentriq or placebo, according to the previous random assignment, every three weeks until progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit. Investigator-assessed PFS and OS in the intention-to-treat population served as the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety. Age, demographics, and smoking status were representative of the disease: median age was 64 years (range, 26-90) in both the Tecentriq and placebo groups, and the majority were male (64 percent vs 65 percent, respectively), white (81 percent vs 79 percent), and former smokers (58.7 percent vs 61.4 percent). The Tecentriq arm included 17 patients (8 percent) with brain metastases and 77 (38 percent) with liver metastases; while the placebo group consisted of 9 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The median duration of treatment with Tecentriq was 4.7 months, with a median of 7 doses received. The investigators saw no major difference in ORR between arms (60.2 percent vs 64.4 percent, respectively) or in median duration of response (4.2 vs 3.9 months). Tecentriq demonstrated superior 6-month (32.2 percent vs 17.1 percent) and 12-month (14.9 percent vs 6.2 percent) event-free rates. Eighteen patients treated with concurrent Tecentriq had ongoing responses compared with only 7 patients in the control arm. The safety profile of the regimen appeared consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the individual agents, with no new findings observed. The most common grade 1/2 treatment-related AEs among the Tecentriq and placebo arms included neutropenia (13.1 percent vs 10.2 percent, respectively), anemia (24.7 percent vs 20.9 percent), decreased neutrophil count (3.5 percent vs 6.1 percent), thrombocytopenia (6.1 percent vs 7.1 percent), and leukopenia (7.6 percent vs 5.1 percent). Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) were more common with Tecentriq compared with placebo (39.9 percent vs 24.5 percent). The most common grade 1 or 2 IRAEs among the Tecentriq and placebo arms included rash (16.7 percent vs 10.2 percent, respectively), hepatitis (5.6 percent vs 4.6 percent), infusion-related reactions (3.5 percent vs 4.6 percent), pneumonitis (1.5 percent vs 1.5 percent) and colitis (0.5 percent vs 0 percent).

"Dear Coleridge, Since joint inflammation and pain is an anticipated side effect from immune therapies, which can emerge long after the actual end of the therapy, you probably should talk first with the oncologist and report this. He may want to you see either doctor, each of whom needs to understand more about Opdivo. Bringing a printout of the side effects from the manufacturer might be helpful, as well as a timeline of your treatments, any prior joint issues, and what you have been doing to manage the pain--what works, what doesn't, etc. Post my high dose interleukin treatments 14 years ago, I had both sharp pains in my shoulder joints, initially diagnosed as 'frozen shoulder'. The physical therapist indicated that I would need therapy as long as a year, which I believed, thinking that the problem was from laying around the hospital for a total of four weeks. However, the 'frozen shoulder' disappeared within about three months, and by the fifth month past my last HD IL2 dose, I was free of the cancer in my lungs. However, at six weeks post that last dose, I was still in a big mess, getting smaller from the earlier scan! To me, that is the ideal success of immune therapy, which meant that my immune system had been revved up and taught how to counter the RCC. Since RCC and other cancers can develop ways to evade the immune system, likely after some years lying quietly in wait until the immune system is completely uninterested, this was proof to me that my system learned what to do about the RCC--more like a vaccine than an antibiotic in its action.",opdivo,2,,,

Hereâ€™s what I did: This is the argument cribbed from the Barts MS website that I sent to my neurologist: 1. Cladribine is at least as effective as other treatments (maybe not HSCT or alemtuzimab).

It works by killing B- and T-lymphocytes, which should decrease inflammation in the CNS. 4. Six subcutaneous injections of cladribine in one year give equivalent plasma concentrations to those used in the CLARITY & ORACLE MS trials. J. Clin. Oncology 10: 1514 â€“ 1518. 5. Everyone with MS needs anti-inflammatory treatment, even progressive MS patients. Cladribine gets into the brain and kills lymphocytes, which should be neuroprotective and slow progession. 6. Itâ€™s an induction treatment, consisting of 60mg/year in 6 sub-Q injections within 1 month. It only requires a single WBC count between the 1st three and 2nd three injections. Cladribine is safe and effective for MS patients. Itâ€™s relatively low cost. I think that it could help slow the progression of my disease. Can you prescribe this for me? Is there anything I can do to get this going? Dr. K. Schmierer is spearheading the cladribine effort at Barts & he was very helpful to me. He even looked up my neuro when they were both recently attending the ASN meeting in Vancouver. My doctor agreed that it was worth a try. Dr.K sent the protocol to us. I am almost 1 month out from the 1st 3 doses. I had blood work done, my wife gave me the injections, also taking an antiviral for 60 days to prevent infections. The injections were ridiculously easy for me to tolerate, even though they were 10mL sub-Q injections. No illness, rashes, inj. site problems. I get more blood work Monday, then my next dose(s) later next week, then I am through with DMDs for the year. Iâ€™m in US, put the cost on my credit card (about $1400 for 1st 3 vials). Insurance hasnâ€™t agreed to cover yet, not very hopeful. Finding a supplier here for the drug was much more difficult than I imagined. Very opaque pricing and availability. PS â€“ Iâ€™m also taking 40mg of simvastatin / day. Maybe itâ€™s also slowing things down.",cladribine,0,,,
"How many years does that cladribine NEDA include? Those Alemtuzumab NEDA values are for two years post treatment, not 7. Prof G can you please elaborate on the cladribine figure here, I'm pretty sure Alemtuzumab fared better than cladribine in the trials.",cladribine,2,,,
"Iâ€™m sorry that you had such a horrible infusion. Iâ€™m very lucky to not have any infusion reaction to Ocrevus, so my latest infusion two weeks ago was uneventful. I know that this is not the case for most people. I started on Ocrevus last fall, so this latest infusion was my first full infusion. The two half doses did not have any negative effect on me and I actually felt pretty good afterwards. However, the full dose absolutely LEVELED me, both physically and mentally. I had a bad few days â€“ exhausted, weak, unsteady and was a raving bâ€”- to everyone around me. After a couple of days I started to feel back to my usual self and this week I actually feel better than I did before the infusion. I found when I started Ocrevus that it had a very positive effect on my fatigue and I feel that way again this week. Everyone reacts differently to medications and I know that your experience could be very different than mine, but I do hope that you will feel better and possibly good after a couple of rough days.",ocrevus,1,,,
Greetings.  My stepmom has stage IV lung cancer with mets to the liver.  It had also metastasized to the bone but was surgically removed in October 2014.  She is asymptomatic with a performance status of 0-1.  She had 1st line treatment with Alimta for just over a year and recently finished four rounds of second line treatment with Keytruda.  Any idea what the 3rd line of treatment might be?  Apparently there are no clinical trials available.   Thanks!,alimta,2,,,
Even if the treatment is 200K (one time for 70% after 5 years) most MS treatments are over 75K a year every year until you die! I think itâ€™s closer to 120k for treatment at NW with some other costs but compared to DMDs it typically would pay for itself in 2 years. The stem cell therapy speeds up recovery the chemotherapy treatment is the curative portion. Look into most MS therapies and you will find many have their roots as chemotherapy agents. A person in theory could go through an intense chemotherapy regimin and have the same effect. There are reputable clinics around the world that offer similar treatments at considerable less cost. This is not the same clinics pushing stem cell treatments as a cure. Your article is uniformed and extremely biased almost if you were on the pharmacutical payroll. Most MS treatments are also associated with severe adverse events including death. Many with one year efficacy on a flare at under 50%. No stopping the underlying cause. Ocrevus the new treatment was a reformulated Rituxan that big pharma pulled from trial since it was running out of patent. This only proves that therapies available and research being done is being stalled to maximize profits at the expense of the patient and exploitation or collusion with the insurance industry. It would be in this countryâ€™s best interest to fund non pharmacutical trials to actually find effective open source therapies. Instead the FDA assures billion dollar barriers that only big pharma can navigate and afford for treatments to reach market.,ocrevus,2,,,

"I am on MEDICARE. if u have Medicare and supplement insurance your Part B of your Medicare will pay 80 % for infusions and the supplemental will pick up the rest. I have found that Medicare prescription Part D does not pay much for any pills or injections because the biologic drugs are in the Tier 5 of the insurance and the price is extreme. wait until u hit the "" Donut hole"".

Anyway, the infusion drugs for RA are: Tocilizumab ( Actemra), Abatacept ( Oriencia ), Infliximab ( Remicade ), Rituximab ( Rituxan ), Golimumab ( Simponia aria) and I think Certolizumab ( Cimzia).

"Hello everyone, I was just diagnosed with RRMS last week (hooray for me) - after a couple months of testing, etc. I got some labs back today. I am JCV negative, which is a relief since I'm considering Tysabri. I have some questions and would appreciate any an all tips or pointers. My MS specialist has recommended that I go on Tysabri right out of the gate. I'm not really sure why - I didn't think to ask at our visit - she spent a lot of time highlighting its efficacy, and also said she does not prescribe injectables because they're no more effective than pills. She did warn me about PML risks and ordered a JCV ratio test. At the time we were unsure about my JCV status and she was recommending Gilenya as a second choice depending on how I felt and what my JCV risk came back at. So now that I've come back JCV negative, I have an (admittedly easier) decision to make and I am pretty sure that she will be recommending I go with Tysabri. First, are there any statistics about how long people are recommended to (or typically stay on) Tysabri if they are JC negative? I've seen the PML risk factors laid out for 1-2+ years on Tysabri and how it changes geometrically over time if you are JCV+, but I haven't seen such a thing for JCV-. Is there such a thing? Are there quantified risk factors for JCV-? I realize, of course, that my JCV-/+ status could change and that will still require monitoring. Second, I've seen some suggestions that Tysabri is a pretty high-powered drug that most people seem to be put on after failing other therapies. I didn't think to ask this at the visit because there was just so much information coming at me, but what would the purpose be for recommending such a drug the first time out? Aggressiveness? Lesion load? Any thoughts welcome. (I suspect lesion load will be it in my case, even though prior to this incident I've had no real reason to believe anything was wrong with me). Third, I do have insurance, but I'm curious about out-of-pocket costs. I realize these can vary across the board, but I'm trying to prepare myself for how this could impact my wallet. What are peoples' typical out of pocket costs with private employer-based insurance, to the extent that can be generalized? Fourth, is there any hard data to suggest that coming off Tysabri itself can trigger serious relapses? I've seen some scare stories, but I'm not sure what to think. Last, has anyone JCV- gotten PML while on Tysabri? I'm sure I'll have other questions, but that's it for now. Thanks for reading.",gilenya,2,,,
"I experienced floaters after most injections Going on 4+ yrs now. 6 to t weeks apart. They disappeared ( out of field of vision) to the bottom of the eye after several days, sometimes a week or even two. After an injection in 2/2017, a very large floater, shaped like an olive slice, dark rim and bright white/neon center remained. I still have it to this day. It is beyond annoying, gets double in size when I bend over, and brighter in sunshine, even with sunglasses. My doctor switched me to Lucentis right away. I reported it to the FDA and was asked for much information. It took a long time. Nobody seemed very eager to be forthcoming. I dealt with the drug manufacturer and the compounding lab. I have the lot number of the vials, the info on the silicone oil used to coat the needle, the manufacturer of the syringe. Now I am waiting for the FDA to run this through their database to see whether there were any other reports on a remaining silicone droplet. Have been waiting for a month now. I will NOT give up.

"In the U.S.  Inflectra Ixifi Remicade Renflexis Available Dosage Forms:  Powder for Solution Therapeutic Class: Immunological Agent Pharmacologic Class: Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitor  Uses For infliximab Infliximab injection is used in adults to treat Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and chronic severe plaque psoriasis. It is also used in children to treat Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Infliximab injection is a monoclonal antibody that works to enhance and improve the immune system. Infliximab is available only with your doctor's prescription.  Before Using infliximab In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For infliximab, the following should be considered:  Allergies Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to infliximab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.  Pediatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of infliximab injection for the treatment of Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of infliximab injection in children with plaque psoriasis . Safety and efficacy have not been established. Appropriate studies performed to date have demonstrated that infliximab injection is not helpful in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . Efficacy has not been established.  Geriatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of infliximab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have infections, which may require caution in patients receiving infliximab injection.  Pregnancy Pregnancy Category Explanation All Trimesters B Animal studies have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, however, there are no adequate studies in pregnant women OR animal studies have shown an adverse effect, but adequate studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus. Breast Feeding There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.  Interactions with Medicines Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving infliximab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive. Using infliximab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.  Abatacept Adalimumab Adenovirus Vaccine Type 4, Live Adenovirus Vaccine Type 7, Live Alefacept Anakinra Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin Vaccine, Live Brodalumab Certolizumab Pegol Cyclosporine Etanercept Fosphenytoin Golimumab Guselkumab Influenza Virus Vaccine, Live Ixekizumab Measles Virus Vaccine, Live Mumps Virus Vaccine, Live Natalizumab Paclitaxel Phenytoin Poliovirus Vaccine, Live Quinidine Rilonacept Rituximab Rotavirus Vaccine, Live Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live Sarilumab Sirolimus Smallpox Vaccine Tacrolimus Tocilizumab Tofacitinib Typhoid Vaccine Ustekinumab Varicella Virus Vaccine, Live Vedolizumab Warfarin Yellow Fever Vaccine Zoster Vaccine, Live Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.  Other Medical Problems The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of infliximab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:  Aspergillosis (fungus infection), history of or Blastomycosis (fungus infection), history of or Blood or bone marrow problems (eg, pancytopenia), or history of or Candidiasis (fungus infection), history of or Coccidioidomycosis (fungus infection), history of or Diabetes or Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (nervous system disorder), history of or Hepatitis B, active or history of or Histoplasmosis (fungus infection), history of or Legionellosis (bacterial infection), history of or Leukopenia or neutropenia (low white blood cells) or Listeriosis (bacterial infection), history of or Liver disease or Multiple sclerosis, history of or Optic neuritis (eye problem) or Pneumocystosis (fungus infection), history of or Psoriasis (skin disease) or Seizures (convulsions), history of or Thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood)â€”Use with caution. May make these conditions worse. Cancer, active or history of or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)â€”Use with caution. May increase the chance of having new cancers. Congestive heart failure, moderate to severeâ€”Should not be given to patients with this condition. Tuberculosis, history ofâ€”Use with caution. Patients may need additional tuberculosis therapy. Proper Use of infliximab A doctor or other trained health professional will give you infliximab. It is given through a needle that is placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 2 hours. Infliximab should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions. You may also receive medicines (eg, allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) to help prevent possible unwanted effects during the injection.  Precautions While Using infliximab It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that infliximab is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. Infliximab may cause an infusion reaction, including a heart attack, stroke, changes in blood pressure, or heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia), while you are receiving it or right after the infusion ends. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have chest pain, fever, chills, itching, hives, rash, dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, headache, joint pain, difficulty with swallowing, shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat. Your body's ability to fight an infection may be reduced while you are using infliximab. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first sign of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you have a fever, chills, cough, flu-like symptoms, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Serious skin reactions can occur while you are using infliximab. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, fever, itching, joint or muscle pain, red skin lesions, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in your mouth, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Infliximab may increase your chance of having a lupus-like syndrome or a liver disease called autoimmune hepatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you have dark brown-colored urine, fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, joint pain, light-colored stools, nausea and vomiting, a rash on the cheeks or arms that is worse in the sun, severe tiredness, upper right-sided stomach pain, or yellow eyes and skin. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used infliximab have developed certain types of cancer. This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, emphysema, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin. Using infliximab may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) or cervical cancer. If you have any changes or growths on your skin, abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain, tell your doctor right away. While you are being treated with infliximab, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Live virus vaccines should not be given with infliximab . Your child's vaccinations must be current before using infliximab. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this. Women: If you have a baby while receiving infliximab, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you are using infliximab. You will need to wait a few months before giving certain vaccines to your baby. Talk to the baby's doctor if you have questions. You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using infliximab. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test. It is important to have your heart checked closely if you receive infliximab. Call your doctor right away if you have shortness of breath, swelling in the ankles and feet, or a sudden weight gain. Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes abatacept (OrenciaÂ®), anakinra (KineretÂ®), tocilizumab (ActemraÂ®), or other medicines called biologics that are used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. Using these medicines together with infliximab may increase your chance of having serious unwanted effects .  Infliximab Side Effects Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Check with your doctor or nurse immediately if any of the following side effects occur: More common  Chest pain chills cough dizziness fainting fever flushing or redness of the face headache hives, itching, or rash muscle pain nasal congestion nausea runny nose sneezing sore throat stomach pain tightness in the chest troubled breathing unusual tiredness or weakness vomiting Less common  Back pain bloody or cloudy urine cracks in the skin at the corners of the mouth diarrhea difficult or painful urination frequent urge to urinate pain or tenderness around the eyes and cheekbones soreness or irritation of the mouth or tongue soreness or redness around the fingernails or toenails vaginal burning or itching and discharge white patches in the mouth or on the tongue Rare  Abscess (area of infection containing pus) black, tarry stools blood in the urine or stools bone or joint pain constipation feeling of fullness hernia (lump in the abdomen or stomach) irregular or pounding heartbeat pain in the rectum pain spreading from the abdomen or stomach to the left shoulder pinpoint red spots on the skin stomach pain (severe) swollen or painful glands tendon injury unusual bleeding or bruising unusual weight loss yellow skin and eyes Incidence not known Bloody nose burning, tingling, numbness or pain in the hands, arms, feet, or legs change in mental status clay-colored stools continuing vomiting dark or bloody urine difficulty with speaking difficulty with swallowing fast heartbeat general feeling of tiredness or weakness heavier menstrual periods hoarseness inability to move the arms and legs itching, puffiness, or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes, face, lips, or tongue light-colored stools loss of appetite loss of bladder control lower back or side pain muscle spasm or jerking of all extremities noisy breathing painless swelling in the neck, armpits, or groin pale skin red, scaling, or crusted skin redness, soreness, or itching skin seizures sensation of pins and needles severe muscle weakness, sudden and progressing slow or irregular breathing sores, welts, or blisters stabbing pain sudden loss of consciousness sudden numbness and weakness in the arms and legs unpleasant breath odor upper right stomach pain vomiting of blood Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

"@avengr13 â€“ I live in SoCal, have progressive MS & considered IT dosed methotrexate among other options. Itâ€™s offered at the Tisch MS center in NYC. I went with cladribine, using the Barts protocol. I thought itâ€™s less intrusive. I like how it gets past the blood-brain barrier to knock down leucocyte activity, should be good to slow progression. The dose for MS is much lower than for leukemia. Itâ€™s equivalent to the lower dose used in the successful CLARITY & OPTIMIZE-MS clinical trials. It was super easy to dose. I did it myself in the evening, then worked the next day, no ill effects or rash or headache. 3 to 6 10mL sub-Q doses over 30 days, then done for the year. Felt much better than interferon shot, a bit trickier than dosing copaxone. The package insert for cladribine and the internet makes some scary reading. But, as Paracelsus says, â€œsola dosis facit venenumâ€. The hard part was getting my neuro to prescribe it & finding a speciality pharmacy that would sell it. Most places are not cool at all shipping off an IV cancer drug to be used off-label by an MS patient at home. I had help from Dr. K at Barts talking with my neurologist and sending the protocol. My neurologist is not currently prescribing Lemtrada, but agreed cladribine is worth trying. It took some convincing, reading and sending journal articles. Be prepared to do same to get any off-label treatment for prog MS. I think it has possibility to slow progression, is easy to tolerate & relatively inexpensive. I paid about 2850$ for 6 10mg vials, retail. My insurance hasnâ€™t agreed to cover. Monitoring your leucocyte levels is important for safety. I went from 1.3 x 10^5/L to 0.9 after 1st 3 doses, so I only took 2 for the second. Will check levels again in November. Sorry for the long comment. I just think itâ€™s safe, easy and it may help with SPMS. I think a treatment like this would be good for all types of MS patients. They have good human data for safety & efficacy. Now, for me, not treating MS, even with no relapses, is a mistake. Any nerve damage from smoldering inflammation isnâ€™t coming back, better to save what you have.",cladribine,0,,,
"I have 30 generic 3 MG tablets of generic budesonide that were prescribed in 2014 in case I needed them while away from home. I have a 1 week trip coming up toward the end of the year and wonder if I can use them as a rescue medication instead of pred. The instructions say to take 2 twice a day. I did find a post by iPoop that states: ""If you don't respond to budesonide within a few weeks then you need its much stronger cousin prednisone."" In addition to the age of the pills I also have to say that Uceris did not help me a couple of years ago. I have a few Uceris tablets lying around too. Does it really take a few weeks for Budesonide to help? Not ideal. I had a recent scope but am unable to see the doctor until January. I have called and don't even have the biopsy results after almost a month. The doctor did mention Humira and prednisone to me more than once, but I could be on my own for a long time. Maybe I should take more than 2 per budesonide day and start with the early symptoms. I want a plan in place in case I have to wait till January. I have to confess that recently I borrowed 5 20mg tabs of pred. Illegal? So shoot me! I was able go to the grocery store, walk the dog and celebrate a very big birthday with family and friends. It was worth it to have that one day. It is not necessary to wean after a few days, but I did anyway, ending with 5 mg for a couple of days. With the pred pills and new Uceris foam the really bad symptoms have never returned, but that could be temporary. So do I continue to beg for a small supply of pred, use what I have on hand, or hope a friend has a few more extra pred? I even know a dog who is taking 5mg! Diagnosed 2010 with left-sided inflammation. Three doctor opinions: UC (likely), Crohn's, indeterminate.

"Reply posted for croninstc. Honestly, diet is different for everyone with Chron's disease. For me, I have tightness in my intestines, so I am on a low fiber diet.

Not completely but probably relevant: I went from Gilenya to Cladribine and I had a four week washout period. The following post is about the washout between Tysabri (Natalizamub) and Lemtrada (Alemtuzumab) but if you read through the comments at the end you will see an answer about washout between Gilenya (Fingolimod) and Lemtrada. They don't recommend a long washout. http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/2012/12/rebound-on-withd...,gilenya,2,,,
"Hello :-) I'm one of those people that buries their head in the sand when it comes to finding out things about the illness and only post when I'm going through a crap time, anyway, I was dx 9 years ago and have done not too badly until this year, I was on copaxone for a few years and only stopped when I started having a bad reaction to it caused by stress as I was going through a lot of emotional things (divorce and associated issues) up to that point I tollerated copaxone very well, I was then put onto another injection but gave up after 1 month as it gave me awful headaches, but for the last 4 years I have been on gilenya, it started very well but this year has been a bit of a nightmare, I get every little bug that is going around and pretty much feel ill all the time, so far this year I've spent 4 months signed off work with debilitating fatigue (not a bug) and was sat in my flat unable to do anything, for the last 9 months I've had a urinary tract infections that won't go away and pills do nothing to shift it, I've had shingles for 2 months now and again medication isn't shifting it and to top my horrid year, yesterday, the left hand side of my face swelled up from my temple to halfway down my neck and my new bulbous head is going from mildly annoying to very painful, oh, and the bottom of my spine is also very painful, this started yesterday too. Well, what I'm wanting to find out is whether or not any others on gilenya find themselves getting a disproportionate amount of other illness, viruses and infections? And whether or not anyone thinks that gilenya might be a factor, apart from the ms I normally keep well and avoid all of the bugs that are going around, at the time of typing this I am sat (tenderly) on my shingle rashed bum, sat slightly forward to help my back pain, with my head tilted to the right to help my swollen face a bit, Oh! I think I have just vented :-) apologies :-) but if anyone has any information or views on gilenya I'd appreciate some feedback as I'm tempted to stop taking it (gradually of course) I would talk to a GP about it but getting an appointment is a lottery and the neurologist is the same, plus I value information about it from real life experience. Thank you",gilenya,1,,,
"hahahahaha of all the things i've been worried about since the MS thing, pronouncing drugs correctly has not even been on the list, let alone on top of it. I pronounce tysabri as teesabri, much to my amusement and to the annoyance of my partner's neuro who never fails to correct me lol. i pronounce Ocrelizumab as the O drug (I'm not crazy enough to even attempt it). I understand why you would be concerned with the correct pronounciation though ;)",ocrelizumab,2,,,
"Increased cancer risk is mentioned in the literature and addressed somewhat offhand by Dr. Chin from Genentech in this article:  This optimism is, however, tempered by concerns of increased cancer risks. In all three trials, cancer rates were twice as high among those who received Ocrevus than among respective control group patients. â€œRates of malignancy with ocrelizumab treatment remain within epidemiological reports and no clear relationship between B-cell suppression and malignancy has been established,â€ said Chin, who also reassured patients that Genentech is working to understand why the rates were numerically higher. https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/03/28/history-of-ocrevus-defiant-idea-to-game-changing-multiple-sclerosis-therapy/ Can anyone explain what ""within epidemiological reports"" means?

"Hi, Thank you so much for your reply JimC. We tried to get brain mets resolved by Cyberknife as one of Radiologist suggested that he can do Cyberknife but when he has done Scan and checked he said that he got different mets on left side as well and he got lining on meningitis, so he said Cyberknife is not the option and he has to go for Wbr. Plus he said he can go for Cyberknife later on once they do Wbr and control the lining of the brain. My question is that he can not switch to Alecensa to avoid radiations if Alecensa penetrate Brain barrears? Or he must have to have WBR? Is that possible to do Cyberknife after WBR? How to cope with side effects of WBR? Anything helpful like any medicine? What to expect after WBR in terms of complete resolution of brain mets without Cyberknife, I know I sound bit silly as every case is different but still any chances, my brother age is 43 and he is in good spirit, he was happy with Cyberknife but he donâ€™t want to go for WBR.

"My husband: Stage IV NSCLC with micro brain mets, liver met, spine mets (treated with photon radiation in 2013), EGFR, Exon 21, L858R. Tagrisso was started in December of 2015.  Lost T790M in June 2016. Carboplatin/Alimta was added in September of 2016.  Chemo combo was started due to pain he was having and the Tagrisso was not reaching those areas (i.e. pleural effusion was causing rib pain, sneezing was a problem and spasm in abdominal area).  All have since went away once he started systemic chemo.  He finished up Cycle 4 and will start maintenance Alimta.  By the way, he is stable at this point both neck down and brain. He has tolerated this combo very well with very little issues.   Also as a side note, he was treated with SBRT radiation in September 2016 on one liver met and the primary lung mass was treated with SBRT radiation in July 2016).  Everything has shrunk and/or disappeared and no pain.  On this chemo combo he has had to delay it every 4 weeks due to low platelets (below 100). The oncologist did mention being off carboplatin may improve platelets.  My question:  is there any data regarding stopping carboplatin at Cycle 4 or going the whole distance to Cycle 6 as far as effectiveness???  I did not know that there was a Cycle 5 and 6 at the time of the visit (learned it later after the visit).  My only comment to the oncologist was that I was concerned if the carboplatin was stopped would progression be sooner.  He said it was protocol to stop at Cycle 4 and to go to maintenance as there is a risk of allergic reactions by staying on carboplatin.   Thanks!",alimta,2,,,

"The  lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing  organs that are found in the chest. The lungs bring  oxygen into the body when you breathe in and take out  carbon dioxide when you breathe out. Each lung has sections called  lobes . The left lung has two lobes. The right lung, which is slightly larger, has three. A thin  membrane called the  pleura surrounds the lungs. Two tubes called  bronchi lead from the  trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also affected by lung  cancer . Small tubes called  bronchioles and tiny air sacs called  alveoli make up the inside of the lungs.  Enlarge  Anatomy of the respiratory system, showing the trachea and both lungs and their lobes and airways. Lymph nodes and the diaphragm are also shown. Oxygen is inhaled into the lungs and passes through the thin membranes of the alveoli and into the bloodstream (see inset). There are two types of  lung cancer :  small cell lung cancer and  non-small cell lung cancer . This summary is about small cell lung cancer and its treatment. See the following  PDQ summaries for more information about lung cancer:  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment Lung Cancer Prevention Lung Cancer Screening There are two main types of small cell lung cancer. These two types include many different types of  cells . The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look when viewed under a  microscope : Small cell  carcinoma (oat cell cancer). Combined small cell carcinoma.  Smoking is the major risk factor for small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a  risk factor . Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer. Risk factors for lung cancer include the following: Smoking  cigarettes ,  pipes , or  cigars , now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer. Being exposed to  secondhand smoke . Being exposed to  asbestos ,  arsenic , chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace. Being exposed to  radiation from any of the following:  Radiation therapy to the  breast or chest.  Radon in the home or workplace.  Imaging tests such as  CT scans . Atomic bomb radiation. Living where there is air pollution. Having a  family history of lung cancer. Being  infected with the  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Taking  beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker. Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older. When smoking is combined with other  risk factors , the risk of lung cancer is increased.  Signs and symptoms of small cell lung cancer include coughing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. These and other  signs and  symptoms may be caused by small cell lung cancer or by other  conditions . Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: Chest discomfort or pain. A cough that doesnâ€™t go away or gets worse over time. Trouble breathing. Wheezing.  Blood in  sputum (  mucus coughed up from the lungs). Hoarseness. Trouble swallowing. Loss of  appetite . Weight loss for no known reason. Feeling very tired. Swelling in the face and/or  veins in the neck.  Tests and procedures that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage small cell lung cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patientâ€™s health habits, including smoking, and past jobs, illnesses, and treatments will also be taken.  Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of  tissue , blood,  urine , or other substances in the body. These tests help to  diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or  monitor the disease over time.  Chest x-ray : An  x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.  Enlarge  X-ray of the chest. X-rays are used to take pictures of organs and bones of the chest. X-rays pass through the patient onto film.  CT scan (CAT scan) of the brain, chest, and abdomen : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A  dye may be  injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  Sputum cytology : A microscope is used to check for cancer cells in the sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs).  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a  pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The different ways a biopsy can be done include the following:  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung : The removal of tissue or  fluid from the lung, using a thin needle. A CT scan,  ultrasound , or other  imaging procedure is used to find the  abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung. A small  incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.  Enlarge  Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lung. The patient lies on a table that slides through the computed tomography (CT) machine, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the body. The x-ray pictures help the doctor see where the abnormal tissue is in the lung. A biopsy needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the area of abnormal lung tissue. A small piece of tissue is removed through the needle and checked under the microscope for signs of cancer.  Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A  bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a  lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.  Enlarge  Bronchoscopy. A bronchoscope is inserted through the mouth, trachea, and major bronchi into the lung, to look for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a cutting tool. Tissue samples may be taken to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.  Thoracoscopy : A  surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a  thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or  lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the  esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes canâ€™t be reached, a  thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.  Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.  Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made at the top of the  breastbone and a  mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.  Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses  antibodies to check for certain  antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a  radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.  Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The  prognosis (chance of  recovery ) and treatment options depend on the following: The  stage of the cancer (whether it is in the chest  cavity only or has spread to other places in the body). The patientâ€™s age, gender, and general health. For certain patients, prognosis also depends on whether the patient is treated with both  chemotherapy and  radiation .  For most patients with small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. If lung cancer is found, patients should think about taking part in one of the many  clinical trials being done to improve treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website .  Stages of Small Cell Lung Cancer Key Points After small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for small cell lung cancer: Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer After small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if  cancer has spread within the chest or to other parts of the body is called  staging . The information gathered from the staging process determines the  stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to  diagnose small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.) Other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following:  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain : A procedure that uses a magnet,  radio waves , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).  CT scan (CAT scan) : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain, chest or upper  abdomen , taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an  x-ray machine. A  dye may be  injected into a  vein or swallowed to help the  organs or  tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.  PET scan (positron emission tomography scan) : A procedure to find  malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of  radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET  scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a  PET-CT .  Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.  There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through  tissue , the  lymph system , and the  blood : Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the  lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the  blood vessels to other parts of the body.  Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called  metastasis . Cancer  cells break away from where they began (the  primary tumor ) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a  tumor (  metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually  lung cancer cells. The disease is metastatic small cell lung cancer, not brain cancer.  View this video on YouTube. Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body. The following stages are used for small cell lung cancer: Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer In  limited-stage ,  cancer is in the  lung where it started and may have spread to the area between the lungs or to the  lymph nodes above the  collarbone .  Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer In  extensive-stage ,  cancer has spread beyond the  lung or the area between the lungs or the  lymph nodes above the  collarbone to other places in the body.  Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer Recurrent small cell lung cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the chest, central nervous system , or in other parts of the body. Treatment Option Overview Key Points There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer. Six types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy Laser therapy Endoscopic stent placement New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Treatment for small cell lung cancer may cause side effects. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with  small cell lung cancer . Some treatments are  standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in  clinical trials . A treatment clinical trial is a  research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with  cancer . When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.  Six types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery may be used if the cancer is found in one  lung and in nearby  lymph nodes only. Because this type of  lung cancer is usually found in both lungs, surgery alone is not often used. During surgery, the doctor will also remove lymph nodes to find out if they have cancer in them. Sometimes, surgery may be used to remove a sample of lung  tissue to find out the exact type of lung cancer. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given  chemotherapy or  radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer  cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called  adjuvant therapy .  Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses  drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or  injected into a  vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (  systemic chemotherapy ). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the  cerebrospinal fluid , an  organ , or a body  cavity such as the  abdomen , the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (  regional chemotherapy ). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and  stage of the cancer being treated. See  Drugs Approved for Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information.  Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy  x-rays or other types of  radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Internal radiation therapy uses a  radioactive substance sealed in needles,  seeds , wires, or  catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer, and may also be used as  palliative therapy to relieve  symptoms and improve  quality of life . Radiation therapy to the brain to lessen the risk that cancer will spread to the brain may also be given.  Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient's  immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biologic therapy.  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a type of immunotherapy: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: Some types of immune cells, such as  T cells , and some cancer cells have certain  proteins , called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep  immune responses in check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased. They are used to treat some patients with  advanced small-cell lung cancer.  There are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: CTLA-4 inhibitor: CTL4-A is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodyâ€™s immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.  Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor.  PD-1 inhibitor: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodyâ€™s immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells.  Pembrolizumab and  nivolumab are types of PD-1 inhibitors.  Enlarge  Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).  View this video on YouTube. Immunotherapy uses the bodyâ€™s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer. See  Drugs Approved for Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information.  Laser therapy Laser therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a  laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) to kill cancer  cells .  Endoscopic stent placement An  endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at  tissues inside the body. An endoscope has a light and a  lens for viewing and may be used to place a  stent in a body structure to keep the structure open. An endoscopic stent can be used to open an airway blocked by  abnormal tissue.  New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website .  Treatment for small cell lung cancer may cause side effects. For information about  side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.  Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a  clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the  standard treatment . Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.  Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from  recurring (coming back) or reduce the  side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCIâ€™s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.  Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to  diagnose the cancer or to find out the  stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your  condition has changed or if the cancer has  recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called  follow-up tests or check-ups.  Treatment Options by Stage For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment of  limited-stage small cell lung cancer may include the following:  Combination chemotherapy and  radiation therapy to the chest.

"Medications are used in multiple sclerosis (MS) to modify the disease course , treat relapses â€” also called attacks or exacerbations â€” and manage symptoms . Along with the other essential components of comprehensive MS care , these medications help people manage their MS and enhance their comfort and quality of life.  Modifying the disease course The following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying agents ( .pdf brochure ) reduce disease activity and disease progression for many people with relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS, as well as progressive forms of MS in those people who experience relapses.  Injectable medications Avonex (interferon beta-1a) Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) Extavia (interferon beta-1b) Glatiramer Acetate Injection (glatiramer acetate -- generic equivalent of Copaxone 20 mg and 40 mg doses) Glatopa (glatiramer acetate -- generic equivalent of Copaxone 20mg dose) Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) Rebif (interferon beta-1a) Zinbryta (daclizumab) Oral medications Aubagio (teriflunomide) Gilenya (fingolimod) Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) Infused medications Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) Novantrone (mitoxantrone) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) Tysabri (natalizumab) Following the treatment plan that you and your doctor have established is the best possible strategy for managing your MS:  Early and ongoing treatment with disease-modifying therapy is supported by the MS Coalition which includes the National MS Society. This evidence-based Consensus on Disease-Modifying Therapies (.pdf) and Summary (.pdf) may be useful when discussing treatment options with your healthcare provider and advocating with insurers for access and coverage. This paper was last updated in 2016. Adhering to your disease-modifying medication is a key element of treatment effectiveness. For help in managing the costs of these medications, read about the patient assistance programs offered by the pharmaceutical companies. Under certain circumstances, some healthcare providers may use medications to treat MS that have FDA approval for other diseases -- also called ""off-label"" use. Over the past few decades, several medications have been used off-label in MS . Managing relapses MS relapses are caused by inflammation in the central nervous system that damages the myelin coating around nerve fibers. This damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of MS. Most relapses will gradually resolve without treatment. For severe relapses (involving loss of vision, severe weakness or poor balance, for example), which interfere with a personâ€™s mobility, safety or overall ability to function, most neurologists recommend treatment with corticosteroids. The most common treatment regimen is a three-to-five-day course of high-dose, intravenous corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and end the relapse more quickly. This regimen may or may not be followed with a slow taper of oral prednisone. Corticosteroids are not believed to have any long-term benefit on the disease. Medication options include:  High-dose intravenous Solu-MedrolÂ® (methylprednisolone) High-dose oral DeltasoneÂ® (prednisone) H.P. Acthar Gel (ACTH) Managing symptoms A wide variety of medications are used to help manage the symptoms of MS . Below are common symptoms of MS and the medications used to treat those symptoms.",ocrevus,2,,,
"I'm still in the midst of the decision-making process too. I was set for Lemtrada at the end of last year but my new neuro pointed out that it's essentially a last-line treatment in that at present, once you've gone onto it you can't move onto anything else as it causes permanent changes to your immune system. This is ok just now but there are a number of new drugs potentially coming online over the next few years that it would mean one wouldn't be eligible for. I was keen to tackle this thing now with a strong DMT as my RRMS is very active but I am now also aware of the fact that one needs to play the long game too.... At present my decision (kind of like Pops I guess) will probably be to go on Tysabri for 18-24 months, see if it's working and/or if my JVC status increases (I'm +ve 0.9 at the mo) and if it becomes to high risk to stay on it, or it's not working then move onto either Gilenya or Lemtrada. It's such a tough call and incredibly stressful so I do feel for you so much. Just remember that it's your body and your decision (I know that sounds obvious but I've had people trying to influence me one way or another as they're scared of certain risks....but they're not experiencing the illness so can't necessarily understand what it means to go through it).",gilenya,2,,,
"Hi All A brief update on my momâ€™s progress and to seek some further opinion. She had 5 rounds of Paclitaxel and carbo up to now (with dosage dropped since the 2nd round due to low white blood cell count) and the CEA did drop from ~4000 to ~2400 at the 3rd infusion. She has been able to cope with the side effects, and the PET scan done after the 4th round also shown satisfactory improvement that near all of the tumors had shrunk in size and activity. However, the CEA value also stabilize and re-increased to ~2900 before the 5th round. She will have her 6th round next week and after that, our primary doctor suggest to pause as he afraid her body cannot cope with the accumulated toxicity. We have also consulted 2nd opinion again through private sector and was suggested to test for a few more actionable mutations (BRAF, RET, MET exon 14 skipping and 1 another) but got a negative result for all of them. Here is a summary of the treatment so far. CEA ~4500 to begin with Alimta + Carbo ( 4 rounds, CEA dropped to ~700) Alimta maintenance (3 rounds, CEA increased to ~1200) Keytruda (3 rounds, CEA increased to ~4000) Paclitaxel + Carbo (5 rounds, CEA dropped to ~2400 before going up to ~2900 again) Her physical status is still good at the moment, with less cough and a better PET scan result compared to the time ending keytruda treatment. However, it seems the situation could go worse soon given the rising CEA values and we are running out of options.  I have a few queries. 1. Is it still worth to seek trying another immunotherapy (though both our doctors at government and private sector did not suggest it as an option). It seems only PDL-1 inhibitors are available in my area but not CTLA-4  2. Is there still other chemotherapy that she can/should try or even re-use? Her doctors refuse to suggest until they think she really needs it. And I could not find much information online regarding 3rd or 4th line chemo treatment. Best regards Mike",keytruda,2,,,

"My mom was diagnosed September 2017 with NSCLC. She was really sick at the time -- couldn't breathe, losing weight, mentally out of it. She slept all the time. After a workup and spending weeks in the hospital with a pleural effusion and a pulmonary embolism she came home to my house with a Plurex catheter. She was draining 400 ccs at first. Once the effusion and blood clot was gone she started feeling better. She qualified for immunotherapy due to her PL1 percentages -- about 70% . She went on Keytruda for about three months and felt well enough to go home! The tumors were shrinking -- but then they started growing again. The doctor took her off Keytruda and put her on carboplatin and pematrexed. She's been on that now for about six months. Before her last appointment the doctor said we would take her off carboplatin if she was ""stable"" and just do maintenance of the pemetrexed. We would find out, he said, after her next set of scans, taken last Monday. Well, here are her latest scan results. Can anyone give me any words of wisdom? What would you suggest? I feel like she should try and get in a study. I'm not ready to give up this fight, and I know she isn't either. Her last scan was in July, BTW. LUNGS/AIRWAYS: Unremarkable. For example: * Right lower lobe subpleural mass with adjacent atelectasis slightly increased measuring 3.2 x 2.8 cm, previously 3.2 x 2.3 cm * Right posterior upper lobe opacity measuring 1.7 x 0.7 cm, unchanged * Masslike subpleural consolidation in the medial basal right lower lobe measures 3.2 cm, unchanged Slightly decreased focus of interstitial thickening/consolidation in the medial basal segment of the left lower lobe. No new suspicious nodules. PLEURA/PERICARDIUM: Unchanged right pleural nodular thickening predominantly in along the lower lobe. Unchanged small loculated right pleural effusion. Increase in size of nodule and right oblique fissure measuring 1.5 x 1.4 cm, previously 1.2 x 1.2 cm. No left pleural effusion. MEDIASTINUM/THORACIC NODES: Increase in adenopathy. For example: * Paratracheal measuring 3.0 x 1.9 cm, previously 2.1 x 2.1 cm * Paraesophageal measuring 3.8 x 2.6 cm, previously 2.8 x 1.5 cm * Right supradiaphragmatic measuring 3.8 x 2.8 cm, previously 3.8 x 2.1 cm Thanks. Obviously, we will discuss with the doctor but I was hoping to get some thoughts before we go in. I am not telling her the scan report is up. I'm going to let her doctor tell her. I can't work. Hardly slept. My siblings aren't much help. My mother has his own medical issues and my sister just doesn't get involved.",pemetrexed,2,,,
"I had a much better interaction with my Mom's doctor today regarding clinical trials and recent advancements in SCLC care, and she advised me that even though we're still in first-line treatment, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get an understanding of the second-line because of how fast this disease can recur and/or spread. There have been a lot of new developments available in clinical trials or even with existing drugs for off-label use, but picking which route to go depends a lot on the specific characteristics of the tumor. For example, some attractive routes vs. standard chemo (which isn't very effective after the first line): -Opdivo+Yervoy: Off-label or Clinical trial - Particularly effective if your cancer has a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) -Keytruda: Off-label or Clinical trial - Particularly effective with high PDL1 expression -Rova-T: Clinical trial - Particularly effective with high DLL3 expression So, my question is: Testing for these specific characteristics is not usually done for SCLC, and indeed the pathology report we got didn't do these tests. Rather than randomly picking a second-line treatment, I'd like to opt for one that's more likely to work. So... Literally, how do we test for these? Order a biopsy and send away to a lab? Is this advisable to do proactively? Would a biopsy be more painful/damaging than it's worth? Just not sure how to go about this.",keytruda,2,,,

For patients with stage IV disease, describing cancer that has spread to distant sites beyond the original tumor, that statistic drops to 2 percent. Now a University of Colorado Cancer Center study published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology tells a much more optimistic story. For stage IV NSCLC patients whose tumors test positive for rearrangements of the gene ALK (ALK+ NSCLC), treated at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital between 2009 and 2017, median overall survival was 6.8 years. This means that in this population, instead of only 2 percent of patients being alive 5 years after diagnosis, 50 percent of patients were alive 6.8 years after diagnosis. â€œWhat this shows is that with the development of good targeted therapies for ALK-positive lung cancer, even patients with stage IV disease can do well for many, many years,â€ says Jose Pacheco, MD, investigator at CU Cancer Center and the studyâ€™s first author.  Study Details: Of the 110 patients on the current study, 83 percent were never-smokers, and had a median age of 53 years. Almost all of these patients were initially treated with the drug crizotinib, which earned FDA approval in August 2011 to treat ALK+ NSCLC, but had previously been available in Colorado and other academic medical centers in the setting of clinical trials. Importantly, after treatment with crizotinib, when patients on the current study showed evidence of worsening disease, 78 percent were transitioned to another ALK-inhibitor, commonly brigatinib, alectinib or ceritinib. â€œMany studies have reported shorter overall survival for patients with stage IV ALK+ NSCLC treated with crizotinib. These studies had lower survival outcomes in large part because of a lower percentage of patients receiving next-gen ALK inhibitors after progressing on crizotinib. Patients here were getting next-gen ALK inhibitors in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials before many other centers had access to them,â€ Pacheco says.  Combination Therapy also a factor Another factor that influenced survival was the use of pemetrexed-based chemotherapies in ALK+ lung cancer. Often, in addition to targeted therapy with ALK inhibitors, patients will undergo chemotherapy (and sometimes radiation). However, there are many chemotherapies to choose from, and it is often unclear which specific chemotherapies are most successful with specific cancers, stages, and patient characteristics. A 2011 study by CU Cancer Center investigator D. Ross Camidge, MD, PhD, who is also senior author of the current study, suggested that pemetrexed works especially well against the ALK+ form of the disease. â€œWe try to use mainly pemetrexed-based chemotherapies in ALK+ lung cancer,â€ Pacheco says, â€œIt is possible shorter survival in other studies may be associated with use of non-pemetrexed based chemotherapies.â€ Interestingly, the existence of brain metastases at time of diagnosis did not predict shorter survival. â€œA lot of the new ALK inhibitors that were developed after crizotinib get into the brain very well, and they work similarly in the brain when compared to outside the brain. And weâ€™re doing more careful surveillance of patients to see when they develop brain mets â€“ instead of waiting for symptoms and then treating, weâ€™re monitoring for the development of metastases with imaging of the brain and if we see something new, we sometimes treat it before it causes symptoms,â€ Pacheco says. The most predictive factor of shorter survival was the number of organs that were found to carry cancer at the time of diagnosis.  Benefits of Targeted Therapy â€œAt this point, 6.8 years one of longest median survivals ever reported for a NSCLC subpopulation with stage IV disease,â€ Pacheco says. â€œIt shows the benefit of targeted therapy and how itâ€™s changing survival for a lot of patients. And I think it suggests that for some types of NSCLC, it may become much more of a chronic condition rather than a terminal disease.â€  Learn more â€‹",alectinib,2,,,

In addition, it wants Regeneron to complete a usability study evaluating a single injection of the Eylea pre-filled syringe in approximately 30 patients as part of the pre-approval process. Regeneron said it expects to complete the study andget the information to the FDA in early 2019 and does not expect the process to delay launch of the Eylea pre-filled syringe.

Without treatment, more than one third of patients developed a vision-threatening complication or diabetic macular edema within one year, Regeneron said. RELATED: An undervalued indication for Regeneron's Eylea could help it weather Novartis threat: analyst It said it was the first trial in NPDR to show both a reduction in vision-threatening complications and in development of diabetic macular edema. Moderately severe and severe diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults. Eylea was able to reduce these complications by 68%-85% even with every four-month dosing, and moreover was able to reverse the anatomic severity of the disease, George D. Yancopoulos, Regeneron's chief scientific officer said in a statement. This is important because Regeneron's foundational drug is under assault by other treatments. Eylea generated about $3.7 billion in sales for Regeneron last year, withabout 70% of its U.S. sales coming from patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). With new drug candidates threatening Eyleas lock on that indication, the company has been testing the blockbuster drug in other areas.",eylea,2,,,
"If all those parasites, worms, fungus, bacteria, etc, can ""easily overwhelm"" someone with a compromised immune system, why doesn't the data show a significant number of people getting overhwelmed by parasites, worms, fungus, bacteria, etc?

As for the skin cancer issue, anybody on these meds should get regular skin checks. Can you show a link that Remicade actually *triples* the risk? More recent studies show an increased risk, but I don't think it's TRIPLED. What's more, the real concern with skin cancer isn't basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, but melanoma - and I'm not sure there is good data on whether Remicade increases risk of melanoma. As for the black box warning, also well-understood. There's a reason why they no longer put boys & young men on combo therapy. I don't think that applies to you, does it?

"Quote from above link to Bart's Blog: 'In short, pwPPMS have unfortunately missed out in the relapsing phase of the disease. They are simply unlucky that a new lesion did not occur in a clinically-eloquent site to cause a relapse and bring them to the attention of a neurologist earlier in the course of their disease. They only present when they have lost their reserve capacity. The good news is we now have a positive trial of ocrelizumab. Let's hope the regulators and payer allow pwPPMS access to ocrelizumab.' This reminds me of a Bart's blog a few years back saying that it's possible that pwPPMS have in fact had RRMS but the symptoms were so mild that it was never investigated as possible MS. For myself I feel this is very true. I had years of weird symptoms that either were not bad enough for me to see a doctor, or lasted for such a short time that I didn't bother seeing a doctor, or when I did see a doctor, were put down to anxiety. And once you have 'anxiety' on your medical notes EVERYTHING from then on is put down to anxiety! In fact, it was to the extent where I believed myself to be suffering with anxiety and believed I was a hypochondriac. After many years I stopped going to see the doctor altogether even though I was suffering with pins and needles, numb patches, swallowing problems, dizziness, pain, and especially fatigue! It was a bad case of shingles on my face and scalp that finally got me to a doctor and, very long story short, finally got me a dx of MS. I wonder how many other of you dx with PPMS also have similar history of odd, unexplained symptoms that could have been mild episodes of RRMS?

"The question of how long will I be in remission, is a lot like the old one about the piece of string? How long is a piece of string, well, it depends â€¦ It depends of how itâ€™s being used, whether itâ€™s frayed and worn, and so on. Similarly, how long will it be before you might go from the relapsing stage to the remission stage, when you have Multiple Sclerosis (MS). At the moment I seem to be happily in the remission stage of MS, and have been like this more or less for more than a year. I say more or less, because I have had brief interludes of relapsing, but only very brief times. These are called Pseudoexacerbation â€“ it means your body is feeling fragile and your MS symptoms jump up and hit you. This may be caused by too much stress, getting too hot, having an infection, being overly fatigued, and for some people with MS intense cold and do the same thing. When the cause goes away, you go back to feeling your version of â€˜goodâ€™. I work hard to reduce the chance of stress in my life â€“ I try to adopt an easy going attitude to life, and just go with the flow as much as I can. I make sure I can keep cool when hot weather is attacking, as it seems to be in my part of South Australia at the moment. Air conditioning and shade are my friends! I try to not overdo things, and if I have, I know I have to rest until by body forgives me again!   These things may take merely minutes to work for me (or anyone with MS) or they may take a day or so or anything in between, but if it is a Pseudoexacerbation, it will go away and not become a full on relapse, and that is a very good thing! A full on relapse could lead to a brain that has forgotten how to work properly, with memory and cognition almost switched off, with overall muscle weakness, and with terrible feelings of bleuhhâ€¦ This current remission I am having is a joy for me, and I am very much hoping this particular â€˜Piece of Stringâ€™ is longer than the length of the journey to the moon and back! Is it because of my current medication, my positive life attitude, my increased levels of exercise (sometimes), or is my body just loving my healthier diet and working harder to fix the damage other parts of my body are doing to me? I love my writing life and if my brain is on the frizzle, I wouldnâ€™t be able to write books and things, like the one in this photo below!   I havenâ€™t had an MRI for some years now, and one of those would indicate how much damage has been done to my Central Nervous System. And my GP has indicated to me that it would be good if I went and saw my neurologist again, so he can see how well Iâ€™m doing on the medication he prescribed for me back in 2012, when this â€˜wonder drugâ€™ (for me), became available in Australia at an affordable cost. This drug, Gilenya, is a tablet I take every day, rather than the injectable drug, Avonex, that I used to inject into my thigh muscle once a week. The Avonex worked OK to help with my symptoms, but the Gilenya is working much, much better â€¦ So going back to the original question, how long will this remission last? The answer can only be â€œWho knows?â€. Gilenya may go on working well for me forever, and I may never have another relapse again. At the moment, Iâ€™m just loving what I have, and working to try to keep it happening as it is now, with my body able to walk and drive my car and my brain able to more or less do all of the things I want it to do! This is my happy MS story, and I hope others out there have their own happy MS stories too, Iâ€™d be glad to hear about it if you do. And if your story is not so happy, why not share that too, sometimes writing about bad things can take some of the bad away â€¦",gilenya,0,,,

"I am a 41-year old male just recently diagnosed with MS. My last year has been rough. I suffer from chronic pain due to a bad vasectomy in october 2017. That left me trying various medications, including high doses of gabapentin. Sometime during spring 2018 I started noticing a numb sensation in my left hand/fingers. Since I was in a car crash in summer 2017 the doctors (and myself) ascribed it to a possible neck injurie (prolapse). In august 2018 I had the vasectomy reversed (several hours operation under full narcosis). A week after the operation my left shoulder and neck started hurting a lot. An MRI confirmed the prolapse in my neck. I was sent to hospital for full MS survey. Unfortunately, this took several months and not until Dec 20 my MS was more or less a fact. The oligoclonal bands from the CSF were still missing though. On dec23 a strong attack started and i went to the emergency unit. After many hours of waiting they gave me solumedrol. As a result of the attack I now have sensation changes in both hands and both feet and my left should is quite weak. I have been pushing like crazy to start DMT and finally last week they approved me for Ocrevus. First infusion is in two days and I can't wait to start fighting back the MS. It has been slowly eating away my myelination for probably more than a year now... In hindsight, there was probably a mild attack in march/april 2018 setting off the numbness in my left hand. Then 2nd attach in august 2018 following the surgery. And finally a 3rd attack in december 2018. Anyone with 2-3 attacks per year and experiences with DMT? I am of course researching like crazy, but its a complicated disease and I have only just started looking into it. Will ocrevus have sufficient ""stopping power"" to halt the disease now or will there be more attacks? Thats a tough question, I know   . Another way would be to ask whether there are anything I should add to increase my chances? I am currently on vitamin B, C, D, fish oil, calcium, linoleic acid (for the chronic pain).

AR-1105 is a bio-erodible implant that is designed to release the steroid dexamethasone over a six-month sustained period. The method of administration is through commonly used intravitreal injection. The potential benefits of AR-1105 compared to other steroid products include six-month duration of efficacy, improved administration due to a smaller needle size, and possibly a better safety profile due to lower peak drug levels. â€œAR-1105 is the first IND-stage treatment in Aerieâ€™s retina pipeline, which is an important milestone for the company,â€ said Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Aerie. â€œThis quarter we also plan to file an IND for our second retina product, a bio-erodible implant containing the Rho kinase/Protein kinase C inhibitor AR-13503 that is being developed for wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. These products demonstrate the potential of our two enabling platforms for delivering drugs to the back of the eye, the bio-erodible polymer technology we licensed from DSM and the PRINT Â® manufacturing technology licensed from Envisia. As we advance these new treatments in our second significant therapeutic area in eye care, we continue to pursue our goal of building the next major ophthalmic pharmaceutical company.â€ About Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Aerie is an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, retina diseases and other diseases of the eye. Aerieâ€™s first product, Rhopressa Â® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, a once-daily eyedrop approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, was launched in the United States in April 2018. In clinical trials of Rhopressa Â®, the most common adverse reactions were conjunctival hyperemia, cornea verticillata, instillation site pain, and conjunctival hemorrhage. More information about Rhopressa Â®, including the product label, is available at www.rhopressa.com . Aerieâ€™s advanced-stage product candidate, Rocklatanâ„¢ (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005%, a fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa Â® and the widely-prescribed PGA (prostaglandin analog) latanoprost, achieved its 3-month primary efficacy endpoint in two Phase 3 registration trials, Mercury 1 and Mercury 2, and also showed safety and efficacy throughout 12 months in Mercury 1. Aerie submitted the Rocklatanâ„¢ New Drug Application (NDA) in May 2018 and, in July 2018, the FDA set the PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) goal date for the completion of the FDAâ€™s review of the Rocklatanâ„¢ NDA for March 14, 2019. Aerie continues to focus on global expansion and the development of additional product candidates and technologies in ophthalmology, including for wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.

"Thank you Poppie, NSSG and Keith-- So I took a step and emailed Cleveland Clinic yesterday to see about an appointment. They emailed me back and offered me a consult with Dr. Daniel Fish, a Colorectal surgeon. I googled him and not much came up. My current Colorectal is Dr. Kann at Oschner in New Orleans. You can google him and read his bio on the Oschner website. Oschner is currently ranked #27 in the nation in Gastroenterology. Dr. Kann specializes in IBD (particularly Crohn's) and I like him, plus I trust my IBD Specialist Dr. Shah (google her, she has quite a resumÃ©). Oschner is the best in my region. Houston is about 4 hours drive away but they are under water right now and that is still quite far. Mayo in Jackson is almost a 10 hour drive--I would have to fly so may as well go to Cleveland in that case. I assume Dr. Kann offered me a colostomy because he thought it would be ok *in my case*, which I appreciate because he is treating me as an individual. He conceded disease could come back but odds would be in my favor--that is reasonable as there are never any guarantees. I like being given options and being able to weigh them based on my personal experience and my goals, which is what Dr. Shah and Dr. Kann have both offered me, diplomatically. Although Dr. Shah has her moments where she can be pushy/controlling, she tries not to be. So anyways, I'm pretty comfortable with them but I do wonder what Cleveland might say. If they might have some more appealing option. And if my outcome might be better based on their hospital's exceptional level of care and cleanliness. But... Oschner is ranked pretty high in the specialty (#27) and my experience with visits (as Dr. Shah is located in the hospital) and colonoscopy were that the staff is competent and facility is clean. I've made the trip there many times and everything is familiar--which makes it much less stressful--and the proximity to where I live makes follow-up care much simpler. Keith--are you considering having your j-pouch removed? My goal with surgery is to get off all IBD medications (except I think I'd rather continue oral mesalamine). So having chronic pouchitis neccesitating antibiotics and also Stelara would not be satisfying for me. Is the ostomy really that bad?? Why do you choose to keep the pouch?

"You're welcome for the Spanish lesson above :) I feel like I haven't written in a long time. Mostly because I have been in so many downward spirals and I don't want to be complaining all over the place. How did my soul decide that this dimension is the one it should experience in more depth and detail? It's like I got derailed. I made a wrong turn back there and I want to turn around. What the hell happened? How did I f*** things up? Did I not realize how fragile happiness is and took it for granted and spit in the face of the Luck Gods? Then I'll get a moment of lightness and get mad at myself for being melodramatic, my symptoms and the infusion weren't that bad, a lot of MS patients have it A LOT worse! Besides, I'm still Lucky! I got a private room for my infusion, I have access to great doctors, I have amazing insurance. I'm supposed to be inspiring! Get it together! But before I write I dive again into my spiral or take some medical marijuana candy, more on that later... Today I woke up singing opera style in Kermit's voice the song Yesterday. I made coffee belting it out and feeling like maybe the steroid high finally kicked in and I got some energy. I was thinking how ironic, or coincidental? it was that yesterday I was feeling like I have no future, no friends, no blah blah blah the last few days and now laughing about it singing Yesterday. It was really funny! Then I opened an email from another Long Rider and I burst into tears while singing and realized this roller coaster may not be completely over yet. And So I Wait. Want some science? SoluMedrol. Corticosteroid Infusion. 3days at 1 gram a day. Stops a relapse in it's tracks. Super powerful anti-inflammatory shutting down active lesions. Very hard on your adrenals. Should not be taken lightly but dramatically cuts down effects of relapse. You can taste it as soon as the IV goes in. Tastes like you are sucking on a penny. I felt it burn through my veins the first time but this time they mixed it with more saline and I didn't feel anything. Most people say they get all this energy from it and love the buzz getting laundry done, organizing, and other cracky behaviors but I slept for 30 hours. That could also be all the ativan they gave me. Another very strong anti anxiety medication. Turns out I freak out at any medical procedure because I don't trust the medical industrial complex and have a healthy fear of dying, pain, and human error but rapid heart rates and shallow breathing are not good for healing so they just shut me down as soon as I walk in. It's kind of pleasant. I put on black clothes and red lipstick, go in, get 2 blankets and 3 pillows, pull out my watercolors, lay down and color until I pass out. A little more science. Rituxin or Rituximab. Produced by a company called Genentech. I am fairly certain Genentech was the name of the evil corporation in some scifi show I may have guest starred on. The more I get into the medical world the more it is EXACTLY like a marvel comic with rock star doctors, crazy billionaires and mad scientists. The world is your hologram and I am projecting some weird shit. Sorry, carrying on. Rituxin is a monoclonal antibody drug used for blood cancers. It's a chemo. An immunosuppressant that ""acts on"" (kills) half of your immune system. The immune system is made of T cells and B cells. All MS drugs have been acting on the T cells because that is generally what is though to be over reacting in our bodies. So the fact that a B cell modulator is so effective on MS is changing the way scientists are thinking about MS. But, Rituxin has been used to treat MS pretty successfully since 2008. It stops lesions at 90%, stops relapses, and can help people with RRMS regain lost function. Why isn't it used more you ask? And why is there the exact same drug, also acting on the B cells coming out this year under the name Ocrelizumab? Maybe because the patent on Rituximab is up this year and there would have been cheaper generic options made by other companies and people could actually get affordable help instead of paying $60,000 a year. Just rumors... So Ocrelizumab, the drama continues. Ocrelizumab is the new brother of Rituxin, basically the exact same drug with a couple little twerks to up the patent and the price (hearsay!). Rituxin though has been used in cancer for years. Then in Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, MS, and other autoimmune diseases. It's been safe and successful. Ocrelizumab however seems to have a lot of instances of cancer. Mostly breast cancer. RItuxin didn't have a bunch of problems with cancer. Would ""They"" really not allow a drug to be prescribed to patients facing disability because ""They"" couldn't make a big enough profit and then spend years and millions developing a slightly worse version that causes cancer and start pushing this super expensive evil twin on the frightened masses? I don't know! All I know is that all of this shit is over my head and is super scary and I have to make decisions that I am not educated enough to make and I tend to turn everything into super dramatic plot lines that start out for my own amusement until I start believing them. I really know nothing about this except what I have read. Ugh breakdown. Point being I am getting an infusion of Rituxin. My doctor is a rock star and got my insurance to cover it (I think). In the words of my favorite MS blogger ""Wheelchair Kamikazi"" it's very ""rogue"" to prescribe Rituxin. It's hard to get prescribed and hard to get approved. It's still a cancer med, not an MS med. It's still chemo. It's still scary. It's 2 infusions that might make me feel sick. They are still killing half of my immune system. I'm very sensitive to things in my body being killed off. It's unpleasant. It feels like being poisoned, because you are! Pointed Poisoning. My new band name. hehehe Rituxin lasts 6 months. Then you get it again. Killing half your immune system. Can I live indefinitely with half an immune system? I think not. I don't want to try. I am very fond of my immune system, even though we are in an abusive relationship. It hurts me but I'll always take it back. It chops off my hands so I kill half of it and then we start again. Eye for an eye and the world goes blind. Or I lose feeling from the nipples down. The infusion should get rid of this numbness and make me able to finish my ride. Then my immune system and I can get a marriage counselor and try to learn to be more gentle with each other. I won't kill it if it will stop eating my brain. I want to go the natural route. I don't want to be part of the system. I want to believe I can be so strict on my diet and meditation that I can strangle my MS. I want to have faith in a slow and deliberate process that I am in control of. But to be super honest I don't think I have that much faith and I don't really like being in that much control. I have tried to be all natural for my remedies before. I have tried only using cranberry juice to cure a bladder infection after having a bunch of sex and after a week of pissing razor blades and sleeping in the bathtub I took my ass to the Dr. for some pills! I want to be wholistic and peaceful! But I am anxiety ridden and I just want to get back on my horse! Literally and figuratively. There is a battle inside of me all the time. That's most likely what triggered my MS. That's what I wanted to focus on during my ride. OR rather Not focus on. I just wanted a simple goal. What does the next 15 miles look like. How do I find water for my horse. How do I keep safe. How do I control this animal. How do I stop focusing on myself and do something bigger than me? How can I help people? Can I just have a simple task, day in and day out, and accomplish it? What is my identity if all I do is accomplish this small goal every day? This 15 miles. Just cover this 15 miles and keep everyone healthy and safe and fed. But it isn't that simple, ever. There are other people and their opinions. There are people who want to scare you and your horse. There are people who want to talk you out of your mission. There is a disease that creeps up and slowly makes you numb until you can barely use your hands. The universe does not conspire with you anymore. But yesterday you were so lucky. Yesterday you were pretty and successful and all your troubles seemed so far away. Now I'm bloated and head achey and want to crawl into a hole. But I am not ready to count the Yesterdays yet. I am being dramatic again on my steroid roller coaster of mood swings. I would rather count all the pleasure and laughing and add that up. I'm glad that I can laugh through the hallways of the hospital, or get woken up out of a depression spiral by an interview with these guys who got so addicted to porn they couldn't get it up anymore and the one guy kept referring to his ""limp noodle"". I laughed so hard that I finally got out of bed. I've been rambling and I don't know if I am melodramatic or repressing things or what. But, I can barely feel my hands and I am getting exhausted at typing and fixing typos. Existential feelings are exhausting. I can't even fathom the future. My chickens are destroying my hillside and aunt flo just got to town so I gotta go get some feminine products. I'm slowly peaking out of my hole, like groundhog day. Unless this Infusion next week scares me back inside! My horse is safe and waiting and I really miss my little camper... I'm super thankful for Nancy Davis and the racetoerasems people. I wanted to support them with this ride and she has ended up helping me tremendously. She called doctors on my behalf and got all this treatment stuff rolling. They did the research on Rituxin and are prescribing it to me. I hope people will start donating to them again once I get back out there because they are really going to find a cure. She's like the beautiful heiress ring leader of medical geniuses and she will find a cure at all costs! I can't think of anything better than contributing in any way I can. Remind me to tell you about my medical marijuana candies next time.... p.s. right after I wrote about not having enough faith in natural curesand all of that I got a phone call from a woman who has MS and runs an animal sanctuary. Me in the future? She beat her MS without drugs, through diet and discipline and prayer. She got my number from a friend who read my blog and contacted her. The convo seemed like fate. Seems crazy but I was seriously doubting and she called at exactly the right time. I won't go on and on but I feel reinvigorated in the nature healing department and feel like I have a lot of meditation/thinking to do. It's weird to figure out all this stuff out loud but hopefully if someone else is thinking about all this life/death, drugs/naturopath, faith/void kind of stuff then it can help? Thanks Diane and Zac :)",ocrelizumab,1,,,

"I am back here after a long break.   Mom was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the lungs in September of 2011 at age 77. She was treated for pneumonia for 5 months, had 11 thoracentesis procedures and no one suspected cancer as there were no tumors, no nodules just fluid. The ER doc ordered a biopsy of the fluid that was drained and it was determined she had stage 4 lung cancer.  Mom has been on alimta since then after a short trial with Tarveva.  She usually goes almost a year with no symptoms until the cancer reoccurs. It always manifests itself as fluid in the lungs which is suspected to be pneumonia.  In November 2015, she was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath, treated with lasix and sent home.  After two more such hospital stays, it was determined her cancer was back.  She was put on Alimta and within a week was breathing better and finished her once in 3 weeks x 6 sessions with alimta last April.  Mom started to have breathlessness again three weeks ago and her PCP thought it could be pneumonia. He put her on amoxicillin after a chest x-ray. Her onc said the X-ray showed no sign of cancer (her last CT was in October and was clear).  This past week, momâ€™s breathlessness has worsened, after 2 more visits to the PCP, she had to be taken to the ER yesterday.  They have been treating her with lasix and have started her on erythromycin and rocephin.  They did get a CT this morning.  There is not enough fluid â€œsettled at the baseâ€ for them to do a tap. The X-ray showed the lungs to be â€œplumpâ€ with fluid (one doc said), another said it shows â€œcondensation.â€  The onc reviewed the CT and doesnâ€™t think there is progression to re-start chemo.  Mom has been hospitalized, they might let her go home tomorrow depending on how she is but her breathlessness has not improved.  I am writing here to ask if there is any test or any other way to determine that her cancer is back.  That is the only way they will put her back on Alimta.   Thanks so much.

"Hi Caroline, thanks for that, I've done a bit more research on Lemtrada and we're definitely not ready for that yet. I've recently read about lots of people going through it and still having bad relapses   Yep, he's not saying too much but I think now things have settled he is a bit more worried about what will happen in his future so it's great to hear from people like you who have still had a wonderful life...we have heaps of conversations about what someone on line said, so thank you   ru4cats Thank you!! That was brilliant! I was a little concerned about the cancer risk but that alleviated a lot of angst. I so wish we could see that Neurologist, I really like him and his hit it hard attitude   Hi Temagami, Thanks so much for your detailed reply. How are you doing on Ocrevus? He can actually get on to some sort of program with his new Neurologist, apparently Ocrevus has been approved by the TGA here but not the PBS as yet but she is able to have 10 patients on Ocrevus, hopefully by June and thinks he should be one of them. So even though he is Day 7 on Gilenya with no major issues, I think he will probably go for Ocrevus. He is keen for an infusion as he doesn't like taking tablets and I'm keen for Ocrevus for the added amount of relapse protection. I have actually pointed him to Dr Jelnick but he's a bit reluctant right now...but as he gets a bit older and wraps his head around it a bit more I think he will be more open. Definitely letting him express himself, at this point I think he's still a bit in denial and is just concentrating on being able to go on his first solo US adventure that he had planned before diagnosis, my guess is after that he might feel the emotional impact a bit more. He has his GP, MS nurse and mates so hopefully enough support outside of us if he needs it   Thanks again to all of you for your support",ocrevus,2,,,
"Lorry I would like to clarify a few observations I made. When I said LMC can progress rapidly I did not mean weeks but more like months. My wife was diagnosed in May and passed away in September. Of course no 2 cases are exactly alike but I would set my horizon on 5-6 months of possible gradual deterioration. I pray it takes longer. When I suggested contacting hospice that does not mean she has to be put on hospice right away. There are numerous factors to consider. We chose to fight it with pulse dosed Tarceva for as long as we were seeing positive results and this was contrary to our oncologists recommendation about 2-3 months in.  I found it very difficult to make the hospice decision because I felt like we were giving up, but in time we realized the Tarceva was no longer working, she was having great difficulty even swallowing pills and was in the hospital more than out â€“ so hospice became the logical alternative and it was the right way to go. What I really meant was that there are a number of choices out there when it comes to hospice such as (1) in home; (2) nursing home; (3) dedicated facility.  Get your ducks lined up now while she is in reasonably OK condition because you donâ€™t want to go shopping when things turn for the worse. Your oncologist if he/she is any good will assist you in making the decision when it is the appropriate course of action. All this being said I hope and pray all that I have said will never come to bear and your mom will be the next Valerie Harper.

"Iâ€™m reading on here that sometimes waiting is the best treatment.  But what defines when you should no longer wait? My momâ€™s history: In July of 2013, an abnormality was spotted in a chest xray, after pnuemonia. In a PETscan, they confirmed a small nodule in her right lung that was definitely cancer, and then there were a lot of â€œlittle sparklesâ€ throughout both lungs. She had a biopsy of the nodule and it was confirmed to be adenocarcinoma. Mom switched her care to Roswell Park, had another biopsy of the left lung where the ground glass â€œsparklesâ€ were, (which came back inconclusive/negative). In October 2013, she had 2 wedge resections of her upper and lower right lobes (removed 3 nodules, 1 with a tiny margin) and they checked out her lymph nodes in the chest (one was calcified, but none were cancerous). The surgeon said her kind of adenocarcinoma is an old subset they no longer use (BAC) which is a multifocal adenocarcinoma with limpidic features. They staged her at IIb and EGFR positive. She went thru 4 rounds of chemo (Cisplatin/Alitma), ending in Feb 2014. .All was quiet for a while and every 3 months we were told NED. Back in October 2015, the oncologist said there was an area they were watching in right lung and it was tiny. He didnâ€™t really give us too much more, just that if it grows they will biopsy it.

"Pinky, glad to hear from you but so sorry to hear none of your drs see fit to give you anything for some pain relief. I would seriously be seeing about getting another pain mgt dr on board. I am not sure if you are aware of this or not, but there are two types of pain mgt dr. One will do injections & procedures only, no pain medication. The other will do the same but will also rx pain meds if warranted. It sounds very much to me like you saw one that does not rx medication. Your surgeon will rx pain meds probably for two weeks only then you will be on your own. Believe me, you will need some pain meds longer than 2 weeks. I think the farther out you can get from shoulder surgery the better before having the cervical done. Thats a lot of surgery to recover from.

"Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) has passed phase 3 trials and is being fast-tracked by the FDA (US authority), it's supposed to be approved on 27th December this year - it then has to be approved by the EMA (European authority, but apparently they usually follow the FDA's lead), then has to pass the NICE criteria. But it's not a myth or a dream, it is a reality, and I discussed it with my MS nurse last month. Perhaps you'll believe the Barts blog: http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/2016/09/researchspeak-ec... - or even this forum - https://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-research/treatments-in-the-pipeline/ocre... . It's not a cure, it slows or halts progression. And that's good enough for me, that will give me some hope. Because, quite honestly, hope is the only thing that keeps me going most days, and it's in pretty short supply. But NICE won't approve it if we all seem to not be bothered, will they? The other DMT is Siponimod, but that's not as far along the approval path ( https://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-research/treatments-in-the-pipeline/sipo... ). I know these drugs are not without side effects and potentially very serious ones, I am very aware of that.

And I really sympathise where it's come too late for people on this forum, I really do, I wish you could have it too, I wish it had been discovered/trialled years ago so none of us would be where we are now, but unfortunately it wasn't.

"I believe it is all MS, but some of your reasoning isnâ€™t quite right (imo). For many people, they start as RR at a later age, say their 50s or older. And many people remain RR all their lives, never becoming progressive. And some people are diagnosed initially as RR in their 20s or younger, then the diagnosis is altered to PPMS within a few years. (Generally PP is diagnosed as such only after a few years with no changes on MRI and no remission phases.) There does seem to be some difference within the category PPMS from the RR/SP variety. The PP tend not to have relapses, maybe odd spots when they get temporarily worse, but not real relapses. And the fact that DMDs either donâ€™t work, or donâ€™t work very well. Hence the Ocrevus scandal, that it does work for PPMS, but not as well as for RRMS, so they canâ€™t have it. Despite there being no other DMDs available to them (this is why I think itâ€™s scandalous!) Then there are people like me, definitely RR for at least 18 years. Then itâ€™s decided Iâ€™m progressive about 2 years ago. Earlier in the summer I had what seemed like a mildish mostly sensory relapse. Then last month I had a proper motor function relapse. Treated it with 5 days of high dose steroids and I had not only a complete remission, but some of the symptoms Iâ€™ve had for years have made slight improvements. So much so that my rehab neurologist went back to his notes from 7 years ago and is astounded by the improvement to my right leg and foot drop. He said heâ€™s seen hundreds of cases of foot drop and never seen improvement after 7 years. (A medical miracle!) So he thinks I should be on a DMD. And when I questioned whether Iâ€™d qualify, having been classified as SP, he said they are starting now to talk more about â€˜Activeâ€™ disease and â€˜Inactiveâ€™. Equally, there are many neurologists and PWMS who prefer to use the word â€˜Advancedâ€™ as opposed to dividing us into categories. So yes, in essence I think your initial question, â€˜Isnâ€™t it all just MS?â€™ is correct, but there are loads of arguments back and forth within that. Sue",ocrevus,1,,,

"Second-generation ALK Inhibitor: Ceritinib To overcome resistance to crizotinib, more potent ALK inhibitors were developed. The second-generation ALK inhibitor, ceritinib, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2014, and other second- and third-generation inhibitors are currently being evaluated. Ceritinib is 20-fold more potent than crizotinib for ALK inhibition, which includes several resistance-conferring mutations including Leu1196Met, Gly1269Ala, Ile1171Thr, and Ser1206Tyr. Results of the phase 3 ASCEND-5 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01828112 ) suggest that ceritinib can indeed overcome crizotinib resistance. 3 â€œTo definitively establish ceritinib as a standard option in the crizotinib-resistant setting, we performed this randomized trial comparing ceritinib with standard of care, single-agent chemotherapy in ALK -positive patients who had failed prior crizotinib and platinum-based chemotherapy,â€ Alice Shaw, MD, PhD, of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and one of the ASCEND-5 investigators, told Cancer Therapy Advisor . The multicenter, international, open-label trial randomly assigned 231 patients with ALK -rearranged stage IIIB or IV NSCLC to receive ceritinib or chemotherapy with pemetrexed or docetaxel. All patients had progressed during treatment with chemotherapy and crizotinib. Patients were allowed to crossover to ceritinib if they progressed during chemotherapy. The overall response rate was substantially higher with ceritinib at 39.1% (95% CI, 30.2-48.7%) compared with 6.9% (95% CI, 3.0-13.1%) with chemotherapy. The disease control rate was 76.5% with ceritinib and 36.2% with chemotherapy. During a median follow-up of 16.5 months, ceritinib treatment significantly prolonged PFS to 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.1-6.9) compared with 1.6 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8) with chemotherapy (HR, 0.49; 0.36-0.67; P < .0001). Though OS data were not mature as half of the required events had not yet occurred, at the time of the interim analysis, death occurred among 42% of patients receiving ceritinib and 43% of patients receiving chemotherapy (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.67-1.49; P = .50). All subgroup analyses, including age, sex, race, performance status, disease burden, smoking history, and previous response to crizotinib, favored ceritinib. Patients with brain metastases at baseline (57% and 59%, respectively) also had improved PFS with ceritinib compared with chemotherapy, suggesting that ceritinib has CNS activity. Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities, including diarrhea (72%), nausea (66%), and vomiting (52%), occurred more frequently with ceritinib than chemotherapy. â€œEncouraging data have been presented that suggest that ceritinib at a dose of 450 mg per day with food has similar exposure to ceritinib 750 mg fasted and significantly reduces GI toxicity,â€ the authors noted. Despite the high rate of GI toxicities, the discontinuation rate of ceritinib due to adverse events was 10%. Patient-reported outcomes were also higher than chemotherapy. â€œIts greater antitumor activity compared with chemotherapy led to improved scores for disease-related symptoms, a significantly longer time to symptom deterioration, and greater benefit in overall health status,â€ Dr Shaw said. The median time to symptom deterioration was 18.0 months with ceritinib compared with 4.4 months with chemotherapy. According to questionnaire data, scores for the composite of pain, dyspnea, and cough were similar between the 2 arms. Yet individual scores for dyspnea, cough, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, chest pain, and others favored ceritinib. The investigators noted that the questionnaire analysis â€œwas often noninterpretable because of low numbers of patients remaining in the chemotherapy group.â€",pemetrexed,2,,,

"A few lingering questions on this topic. [1] 1. I find it strange that Ocrevus, a CD20 blocker, is akin to Rituxan but not even on the map for treatment of NMOSD although Rituxan has been extensively used for this disease. Anyone have any idea why this is ? 2. What is double-negative (Ab) NMOSD ? Does it exist ? Or is it a figment of one's imagination ? 3. One hopes that there are better guidelines for monitoring CD19 cell counts (how frequent, end-points, pitfalls, variations between end-stage disease and early onset disease, if any). 4. Pregnancy vs DMDs in NMOSD is characterized by paucity of data. We need better data.

"Paul: What would you say about your current symptoms? Dave Bexfield, MSers Expert and founder of Active MSers: Well, thatâ€™s interesting because for the firstâ€¦ right after the treatment, thatâ€™s when the biggest change occurred. I would say in the first two months I went from walking barely a hundred metres, I could put in 500, 600, even 700 metres. And then by year one I could hike for maybe two miles, with rest. My longest hike was maybe two and a half, maybe three miles, in one day. But â€“ and this is a but, and this is unfortunate but it happens â€“ even though I was the ideal candidate for this treatment, I started to backslide about year four. That would have been 2014 or so. I noticed that I wasnâ€™t doing quite as well and in 2015 in my last study update, I could do 200 metres unaided, not quite. And now, unfortunately, Iâ€™m back to using my walker, which is a little bit frustrating. Iâ€™m better in pretty much every other area. Cognition is fine, my vision is fine, I donâ€™t have any fatigue. Iâ€™m doing, for someone with MS, actually pretty well, but my legs arenâ€™t doing great. So in 2015 I started on a new treatment, I started on Aubagio, and then that wasnâ€™t really cutting it, so then a year after that I went on to Rituxan, so right now Iâ€™m on Rituxan, I might switch over to Ocrevus if my insurance company says sure. So weâ€™ll see. Would I do it again? Oh hell, yeah. I mean it saved my life, but it was not a cure, at least in my case.

"My mother passed away on 8/22/2016 due to stage IV non small cell adenocarcinoma and ultimately leptomengieal carcinomatosis. (I will include dates below so there is a clear timeline.)  On March 10, 2016 I realized my mom was acting odd, the best way I could describe it was spaced out and lethargic. I didnâ€™t think much of it I thought maybe she was taking too many sleeping pills at night or something. On March 15 she called me and told me that she had fallen (due to poor balance) and needed to get a X-ray of her wrist because she thought she had broken it. We went to walk in clinic who thought she possibly had COPD and was not getting enough oxygen which caused this fog she was in. That was not the case. We followed up with her primary who ordered a chest X-ray and everything was clear. I knew something was wrong and insisted on a brain MRI. That was the day everything changed. They found multiple (they stopped counting at 30) lesions on her brain and she needed to be admitted to the hospital immediately to find out what was causing this, at this point they did not know the primary cancer. They were unsure what type of cancer it was since her chest X-ray was clear. After further testing, a nodule on her lungs were found and after a broncoscophy, it was confirmed that she had stage IV non small cell adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated. (Why was the chest X-ray clear if it was lung cancer? She did have a bit of a lingering cough but nothing that was alerting. She has multiple chest X-rays that all came back clear. She was having incontinence problems since at least October 2015. I wonder if this was related or just a coincidence)  She was impatient for 10days while they developed a plan of care and she began whole brain radiation on 3/25 and it ended on 4/7 for a total of 10 sessions.

Introduction  Co-authors Michelle Fabian, MD and Stephen Krieger, MD This yearâ€™s streamlined MS Research Update has been refined to emphasize numerous experimental drugs currently under investigation for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Entirely new clinical trial data on some of the approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) has also been included. Please note that in order to keep this annual Research Update current and up to date, historical background and completed trials of approved DMTs are no longer included. View a chart giving an overview of the approved DMTs . This 2016 edition of MSAAâ€™s MS Research Update is again being printed as a stand-alone issue, reflecting the incredible diversity and scope of research progress in MS. There is nonetheless far too much ongoing research in MS therapeutics for all of it to be covered here. This is therefore not a complete list, and not all study results could be included. This information is based on a wide range of sources, including extensive journal literature on MS and its management, a review of ongoing clinical trials, and papers presented at major national and international conferences. These include the 2015 conferences hosted by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), and the Americas and European Committees for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS and ECTRIMS). More than 20 years have passed since the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BetaseronÂ® (interferon beta-1b), the first disease-modifying therapy for MS, and the beginning of the MS-treatment era. The â€œwatch and waitâ€ approach to MS therapy has become a thing of the past, in favor of a proactive strategy to prevent MS-disease activity and disability. Preferably, treatment is now often started when a person is diagnosed as having a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). This is defined as a single attack (or the appearance of one or more symptoms characteristic of MS), with a very high risk of developing MS, when no other diseases or causes for symptoms are apparent. The use of MRI scans to identify lesions characteristic of MS has expedited diagnosis. Numerous studies with multiple types of DMTs have confirmed that early treatment at the time of CIS is beneficial in the long term. The past two years have seen the approval of a new formulation of CopaxoneÂ® (glatiramer acetate), dosed three times per week versus daily, as well as a new type of interferon called PlegridyÂ® (peginterferon beta-1a), which is dosed once every two weeks. A new agent given by a series of infusions once yearly, LemtradaÂ® (alemtuzumab), was approved by the FDA at the end of 2014. With the success of research initiatives and the expanding number of approved medications, the choice of disease-modifying therapy has grown more complex. In 2014, experts from member organizations of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition (MSC), including the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA), collaborated to develop and write a paper summarizing the current evidence that supports the FDA-approved DMTs for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis. The objectives were to provide evidence for the effectiveness of these medications and to provide support for broad access to these approved therapies for people with MS in the United States. Ultimately, the goal is to enable individuals with MS and their medical professionals to select the most appropriate medication available. This professional paper, titled â€œThe Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence,â€ is available on MSAAâ€™s website for anyone to review. It has been written expressly for medical professionals, in a highly detailed and scientific style. This paper for professionals may be accessed by going to mymsaa.org/msc-dmt-full . Following the release of the professional paper, member organizations of the MSC have collaborated to develop a summary, written in a more reader-friendly style to better serve the broader MS community. This paper is available on MSAAâ€™s website as well and is titled, â€œThe Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence; SUMMARY.â€ This summary directly correlates to the different sections found within the professional version, but has simplified the information to highlight main points and incorporate more commonly used terminology. In addition, the summary is followed by an extensive glossary to assist with those terms specific to describing the MS process. This paper on the approved DMTs is a valuable counterpart to this Research Update, which is focused on summarizing new and emerging data covering available therapies as well as emerging treatments still in development. This paper for the MS community may be accessed by going to mymsaa.org/msc-dmt-summary .   Please note that the authors have reported on the most recent study results available at the time of publication. While every effort has been made to provide meaningful, timely, and balanced information on each medication, keeping the length of information equal for each medication is not possible. Please know that the different lengths of text should in no way be considered as favoritism toward any one product. Additionally, references have only been cited for the newer study results. As symptom-management drugs do not fall under the scope of this report, for more information on the specific symptoms of MS and treatments for managing these symptoms, please visit mymsaa.org and select â€œ Symptoms â€ under â€œMS Information.â€ For information on trial phases, please refer to pages 38 and 39. Readers may also note that studies involving progressive forms of MS are highlighted with the mention of progressive MS appearing in bold type. This is because all of the 13 presently approved DMTs are for relapsing forms of MS, and the authors of this publication want to also bring studies for progressive MS to the readersâ€™ attention. Editorâ€™s note: Initial study results from therapeutic agents under investigation should be considered as preliminary, since additional studies and/or evaluations may be needed to prove the safety and efficacy of these agents. MSAA does not endorse or recommend any specific products or therapies. Readers are advised to consult their physician before making any changes to their medication, diet, exercise, or other treatment regimen.  FDA-Approved Medications This MS Research Update 2016 , covering information from the year 2015 and early 2016, must begin with a sobering note in regard to the failure of two highly anticipated clinical trials in progressive MS. By testing approved medications for relapsing MS in progressive disease, the possibility of extending the use of these well-known medications for progressive MS may be rigorously explored. Unfortunately, as discussed below, success in relapsing MS does not always predict similar efficacy in those with progressive disease. We begin with some of the unsuccessful studies of 2015 before moving on to the numerous positive avenues of ongoing MS research in both relapsing and progressive forms of MS.  New Data TysabriÂ® (natalizumab) GilenyaÂ® (fingolimod) Experimental Medications Administered Orally Laquinimod (also known as NerventraÂ®) Monoclonal Antibody Medications About Monoclonal Antibodies Monoclonal antibodies are derived from cells that are identical (cloned from a single cell and then replicated). They are produced from animal tissue, most commonly laboratory mice. Humanized monoclonal antibodies are antibodies from non-human species, again commonly a mouse, whose protein sequences have been modified to increase their similarity to antibodies produced naturally in humans. Monoclonal antibodies can be extremely powerful and effective, as they can be specifically directed toward a certain part of a system while leaving the other parts of the system untouched. This can be very desirable when trying to impact a structure as complex as the immune system. The name of all monoclonal antibodies ends with â€œmab,â€ including natalizumab (Tysabri) and alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), which are already approved for MS. Several other monoclonal antibodies have shown promise in MS, and these are reviewed in this section.  Daclizumab (Zinbryta) RituxanÂ® (rituximab) Ocrelizumab Ofatumumab (also known as ArzerraÂ®) Vatelizumab New S1P Receptor Modulators Data have been presented on several investigational oral agents, now in ongoing clinical trials, which have a mechanism similar to that of Gilenya, by isolating lymphocytes (that damage myelin) in the lymph nodes. These agents have been well-tolerated and reduced lesions related to RRMS. It is hoped that these agents, ozanimod (RPC1063), siponimod (BAF312), and ponesimod, will maintain or potentially improve on the efficacy and safety of Gilenya. However, researchers continue to remain vigilant with regard to cardiovascular side effects, such as bradycardia (slowed heart rate).  Ozanimod (formerly RPC1063) Siponimod (BAF312) Ponesimod Other Therapeutic Strategies Masitinib (also known as KinavetÂ® and MasivetÂ®) Ibudilast Tcelnaâ„¢ (formerly TovaxinÂ®) Tetracycline Antibiotics Statins New Therapies under Investigation The earlier listing of approved and experimental drugs is only a fraction of the many treatments currently being studied. Some of the following are among the most exciting potential therapies under investigation. These very brief snapshots of highly technical concepts will warrant more in-depth explanations in the future, if pilot clinical trials are encouraging. Anti-LINGO : LINGO-1 itself is a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination and prevent the survival of neurons. The cells making up all organs in the body receive such â€œinstructionsâ€ regarding when to grow and when to cease growing. Without these sorts of cellular â€œchecks and balances,â€ tissues could grow without restraint, as seen in some malignancies. Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) is an agent with potential remyelinative properties, after animal studies showed that it blocks this protein responsible for stopping the growth of myelin. It was shown to promote spinal cord remyelination and axonal integrity in the animal model of MS (EAE). The first trials of experimental anti-LINGO to stimulate myelin repair â€“ human Phase I trials, 28 involving 64 healthy adult volunteers and 42 people with relapsing or secondary-progressive MS â€“ have been completed. In these trials, intravenous (IV) doses of anti-LINGO were well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events; headache was the most frequent adverse event reported. The first Phase II trial of anti-LINGO, called RENEW, launched in 2013. 29 The study recruited patients with newly-diagnosed MS involving the visual pathways (optic neuritis) to evaluate the drugâ€™s effect on remyelination. Results were presented in spring 2015. The primary outcome of RENEW was an assessment of recovery of optic-nerve function measured by the speed at which the nerve conducts visual signals. This was studied by evaluating a test called Full Field Visual Evoked Potential (FF-VEP) in participants treated with anti-LINGO-1, compared with placebo. Patients who were treated with at least five of the six doses of anti-LINGO-1 showed a 34-percent improvement in optic-nerve conduction latency (delay in the speed of the visual signal) at week 24, compared with placebo. Further recovery in optic-nerve conduction was observed at the last study visit (week 32), with a statistically significant 41-percent improvement. Together, the data demonstrate evidence of treatment effect with continuous improvement observed 12 weeks following the last study dose. The study showed no effect on secondary endpoints, including change in thickness of the retinal layers (optic nerve neurons and axons) as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT), or on visual function, measured by a test of vision called low-contrast letter acuity. Anti-LINGO-1 was generally well-tolerated in this study, noting that two patients had hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions at the time of infusion, and one patient had liver function test abnormalities, which resolved after drug discontinuation. Taken together, these results provide an encouraging indication that anti-LINGO-1 appears safe and may facilitate remyelination, though meaningful clinical outcomes will need to be assessed in larger trials. To that end, a second, larger Phase II trial (SYNERGY) 30 is looking at this drug in combination with Avonex. The study will recruit approximately 400 patients with both RRMS and SPMS, and will examine the degree to which patients have an improvement in disability with anti-LINGO. Since this agent does not reduce relapses or prevent new MRI lesions, further studies with anti-LINGO, and other potential remyelination therapies, will need to utilize new endpoints to prove efficacy. These include measurements of recovery or improvement on physical, visual, cognitive, and other functional assessments of the effects of MS. Results will provide clinical information about this drugâ€™s efficacy for neuroprotection or repair within the central nervous system (CNS). The results will also address two fundamental questions: 1) Are the effects seen in the optic neuritis study replicable in other areas of the nervous system? And 2) Does this translate to improved function in patients with MS either in the short or long term? Other experimental treatments under investigation to potentially foster remyelination or myelin repair include agents in early stages of development â€“ and still with experimental names â€“ such as GSK239512 31 and rHIgM22 . 32 Proof-of-principle data are expected for both of these agents in 2016. Amiloride, Phenytoin, and Sodium Channel Blockade: The accumulation of salt and potassium within the cells of MS lesions may possibly contribute to cellular injury and neurodegeneration (the breakdown of nerves). This hypothesis would suggest that by blocking certain channels in these cells, the buildup of these molecules can be prevented and neurodegeneration can also be prevented. This strategy was tested and data presented in 2013, 33 looking at the use of amiloride â€“ a potassium-sparing diuretic approved for the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. This medication may have the potential to provide this neuroprotective activity. The effect of amiloride was studied in 14 people with PPMS using MRI markers of neurodegeneration as outcome measures of neuroprotection. Patients with PPMS underwent MRI scans before and during amiloride treatment, at a standard dose used for high blood pressure, for a period of three years. Researchers found a significant reduction in the development of brain atrophy, as well as a slowing of the development of disability during the treatment phase. This suggests that amiloride may exert neuroprotective effects in patients with PPMS. Because amiloride does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, the precise mechanism for these results is not clear. This pilot study was the first effort in people with MS to focus on neuroprotection using amiloride, and supports further investigation of this drug as a potential neuroprotective agent in MS. A Phase II trial studying this agent in optic neuritis 34 was initiated in 2013 and data is expected in 2016. This study is similar in principle to the RENEW study of anti-LINGO-1 as discussed above, as the attempt is to foster protection and repair in the optic nerve in the acute phase after optic neuritis. It is worth noting that this strategy was successful in a study of the anti-seizure medication phenytoin (brand name DilantinÂ®), which also works by modulating sodium channels. A Phase II clinical trial assessed whether phenytoin could be neuroprotective in acute optic neuritis 35 (AON). The study was comprised of 86 people with AON randomized within two weeks of symptom onset to receive either phenytoin (4 mg per kg daily) or placebo for three months. The primary outcome of this AON study was an evaluation of the structure of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular volume (MV) at six months. Visual function, optic-nerve imaging, and visual-evoked potentials were also measured. Of the original 86 participants, 81 were followed to study end. In these patients, the average adjusted affected eye RNFL thickness at six months was higher in the active group versus placebo, resulting in a 30-percent protective-treatment effect. Adjusted MV (macular volume) showed a 34-percent protective-treatment effect. Vision generally recovered well, with no significant difference in visual outcomes between the treatment groups. This intriguing study may have broad implications, as it found that the administration of a well-known, relatively safe drug seemed to be neuro-protective in the period directly following optic neuritis. Both amiloride and phenytoin may also represent potential combination strategies in conjunction with immune-modulating, disease-modifying therapies. Idebenone (CatenaÂ® SovrimaÂ®): This experimental drug, similar to coenzyme Q10, was initially developed to treat Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other cognitive defects. Coenzyme Q10 is produced within your own body and is necessary for cells to grow and remain healthy. This substance also works as an antioxidant, helping to prevent injury from the oxidation process. It is being explored in MS because oxidative stress has been postulated to play a role in the death of myelin-producing cells, which has been linked to MS progression. Oxidation is the bodyâ€™s natural metabolism of oxygen. When disturbances occur in this process, â€œoxidative stressâ€ can result, causing damage to the bodyâ€™s cells and tissues. Oxidative stress is believed to be a contributing factor in many diseases, including those affecting the nerves and the immune system. A double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial of idebenone, 36 sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, recruited participants with PPMS who had little to moderate disability. The trial began in July 2009 and is scheduled for completion in September 2016, with an extension trial continuing through 2018. MIS416 : This â€œtherapeutic vaccineâ€ is a potent activator of the innate immune system, which provides immediate defense against infection but does not result in long-lasting or protective immunity. As a side note to help explain this type of immune-system defense, the â€œinnateâ€ or â€œnaturalâ€ immune response is nonspecific. It does not have any type of memory, and reacts in the same way each time it encounters a foreign entity, such as a virus or bacteria. MIS416 has been primarily tested in cancer and acquired infections, with the goal of enhancing the inherent capability of a personâ€™s immune system to fight disease. A Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV-administered MIS416 in people with either PPMS or SPMS presented interim results in 2012. This open-label, dose-escalation/confirmation trial showed MIS416 to be well-tolerated and identified a clinical dose for further evaluation. Moreover, during the dose-confirmation portion of the study, eight of 10 patients with SPMS who were treated with MIS416 for 12 weeks showed some improvement. A further Phase II study 37 in SPMS is planned to be completed in late 2016. Transdermal Administration of Peptides: A small Polish study of 30 individuals 38 with RRMS evaluated the efficacy and safety of transdermal (skin patch) administration of two dose levels of three myelin peptides: MBP 85-99, PLP 139-151 and MOG , versus placebo. In the lower-dose group, which received 1 mg each of the three peptides, the annual relapse rate at one year was reduced by 65 percent compared with placebo. Progression, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), was slightly lower, indicating that disability did not worsen, and may have slightly improved. Additionally, 56 percent were relapse-free versus 10 percent in the placebo group. The treated group also showed a decrease in gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume and T2-lesion volume. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. This approach of using a combination of peptides may be pursued in future studies. IL-17 Modulators: Secukinumab (AIN457) and CJM112 . IL-17 is one of several cytokines produced by the immune system. Cytokines are small proteins that may stimulate or inhibit the function of other cells. IL-17 appears to be a major inflammatory component in MS. Secukinumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-17. A preliminary study 39 administered AIN457 by intravenous infusion to a very small number of patients with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and uveitis with variable results. A proof-of-concept trial in RRMS 40 enrolled 73 patients and showed a reduction in gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions compared with placebo. 41 A larger, Phase II trial was planned to enroll approximately 380 patients with relapsing MS; the design of the study was presented at ECTRIMS in fall 2013, but was cancelled in favor of the clinical development of CJM112, which also targets IL-17 and is administered by subcutaneous injection. The design of the Phase II trial was presented at ECTRIMS in the fall of 2015. To date, no individuals with MS have received this experimental treatment. SB-683699 (firategrast) is an oral agent thought to reduce the number of active white blood cells entering the brain. It works via a similar mechanism to Tysabri. It had positive results in a Phase II trial 42 using gadolinium-enhancing lesions as the primary outcome. ATL1102 is an oral agent that affects the VLA-4 system, the same molecular mechanism utilized by Tysabri. It does so via a novel mechanism of action, and falls into a class of â€œantisense oligonucleotidesâ€ not previously used in MS. The results of a Phase II trial were published in 2014 43 , noting that ATL1102 decreased the emergence of new active brain lesions as compared with placebo, after only two months of treatment in approximately 70 RRMS patients. As of 2015, the development path for this agent is still being considered. Pixantrone (PIX) is under investigation as an alternative for the effective but cardio-toxic drug NovantroneÂ® (mitoxantrone or MIX) in the treatment of aggressive RRMS or SPMS . In a Phase I/II study of 18 patients with aggressive disease, results presented in 2014 44 showed that pixantrone was as effective as Novantrone, but with less cardiotoxicity. Although via a different mechanism of action than rituximab and ocrelizumab, pixantrone was shown in this study to reduce B cells by 95 percent. According to the study abstract,45 pixantrone is structurally similar to Novantrone and both drugs have similar immuno-suppressive properties in animal studies. However, the authors state that pixantrone is less toxic to the heart. SR-CRH-01 is a stabilized, neuropeptide, also known as Aimspro Â®. In a Phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 20 people with SPMS presented in 2014, 46 SR-CRH-01 was well-tolerated when given by subcutaneous injection twice weekly for four weeks, resulting in significant improvements in several secondary endpoints. These endpoints included the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25-FW), and the mean 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). Larger, longer-term studies are warranted given these promising results. However, no new trials are presently being conducted.  New Directions in MS Research New Therapeutic Approaches Vitamins and Electrolytes Vitamin D3 Biotin Salt Stem Cells Biomarkers Genetic Studies The Microbiome and MS Closing Notes In summary, the future of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS continues to be promising, both in terms of new information about currently approved DMTs and exciting results for emerging therapies. Advances in genetic and biomarker studies hold the promise that, in the future, it will be possible to personalize the decisions about MS therapy in a precise, biologically-driven manner. More than ever, the field of MS research relies upon the willing participation of patients in clinical trials. We now recognize how ethnically, racially, genetically and culturally diverse the MS community is, but diversity in our clinical trial populations is lacking. In 2015, data from six randomized, placebo-controlled trials were used to examine the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes in white, black, Asian, and Hispanic populations. The results were challenging to interpret due to the incredibly low number of non-white participants in clinical trials, which in turn makes our clinical trial results hard to interpret in the real world. The field of MS research needs a diverse population recruited into clinical trials if we are to truly know that our medications are globally effective in MS. Despite the setback of unsuccessful trials in progressive MS, ongoing clinical trials in both PPMS and SPMS , as well as investigations into neuroprotection, remyelination, and repair, offer great promise for the treatment of progressive MS and the goal of reversing the damage caused by this disease. In recent years, our arsenal of MS therapies has grown considerably, with more on the way. Along with these new therapies come a host of new challenges and risks, which will require vigilance and a thoughtful approach to medication selection and management. As clinicians have more numerous and more complex treatment options to offer patients, the need for patient education and awareness has become more crucial. Now more than ever is the age of empowered, highly-informed patients, who can be true participants in their MS care in collaboration with their treatment team. We hope this update is a valuable part of that process. For more information about clinical trials, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .

"December 29, 2017 Clomipramine, an approved antidepressant, shows potential in treating people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) â€” a disease form with few treatments â€” by protecting nerves from various processes thought to underly progressive MS, early research shows. The lab and animal study, which focused on already-approved treatments, was titled â€œ Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic â€ and published in the journal Nature Communications . A variety of therapies exist for people with relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ), which is marked by exacerbations or flares. But fewer exist for people with progressive MS, and only one, Ocrevus ( ocrelizumab ), is approved for those with primary progressive disease. Among reasons for this are the markedly different underlying processes underlying these two types of MS. â€œThe mechanisms causing damage in progressive MS are not always the same as in relapsing-remitting MS. This is why the latter requires different therapeutic approaches,â€ Simon Faissner, a researchers with the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Canada and the studyâ€™s first author, said a press release . Progressive MS involves severe aspects of neurodegeneration, accompanied by iron-mediated neurotoxicity, immune cell activity, and oxidative stress. An effective treatment essentially needs to address all these mechanisms.

"Sorry, pred is truly awful, remind yourself it's just temporary and I hope the Humira is your longterm ticket to club-remission. While on pred, do try and limit your salt intake to reduce bloating and water retention some (there's no prevention but limiting salt limits it some). Up your calcium and potassium intake as pred wastes those two things from our system. If you can, do some light, weight-bearing exercise to slow calcium wasting. I've been on pred a number of times over the years. During my worst flare, I lost 17 pounds of weight due to the flare and regained about 12 pounds of weight due to my insatiable pred appetite. A few weeks after ceasing pred, I noticed a couple pounds disappeared from water retention. However, the majority of the weight gain was sustained due to increased caloric intake. I'd eat a big meal, and not 15-minutes later I'd be starving like I hadn't eaten all day long. Try eating filling but low caloric things. Examples are air-filled things like a bowl of butter-free popcorn or water-filled things like a bowl of soup or broth. You fill your stomach up and you'll be free for a bit. The longer you have a chronic illness the easier it gets. UC is real rough on our bodies causing dramatic weight loss, pred can cause dramatic weight gain, we can loose hair, and these are things that are entirely out of our control. We can fret over these things or just let them go. At one of my remicade infusions, I spoke with a nice lady who had Crohn's for over 30 years.

"The thoracic surgeon described an incision in my ribs 3-4 inches, spreading my ribs, and inserting his hand to feel for the tumors so I am pretty clear that it is a thoracotomy.   I asked about VATS and robotic surgery and the response was they would use whatever means was necessary and he would remove as little tissue as possible but would remove any/all nodules.   This is the hospital that did my original lobectomy (lowest lobe of right lung) using the Da Vinci robotic system. While it was not the surgeonâ€™s first use of the system, I did not find out until after the surgery that it was the first time the system was used at this facility.  The surgeon who performed has moved to a different facility so this surgery would be performed by a different doctor who typically does a heart and a lung surgery daily so is very experienced according to his nurse.  I spoke with the office again and the oncologist  is insisiting the tissue be removed.  Part of me wonders if it is CYA since they never tested the new areas using either PET or biopsy before having me start Tarceva (which was the only option discussed with me when I was diagnosed.) cards7up â€“ I am not clear how to describe where the tumors are as the location isnâ€™t described in the reports.  It looks close to the spinal column and the surgeon suggested it was close to the heart.  The reports say there are a slight increase to the right upper lobe nodule currently measuring 1.4 x 0.9 cm, a stable subpleural nodule in the anterior right upper lobe measures 5 mm, and a stable 7 mm right internal mammary chain lymph node. Who does one call to request a second opinion/consult? UCLA, City of Hope, and USC are all within  driving distance.  Do I just choose one and call to ask for second opinion consult?

"Marlo: Is oral chemotherapy an option for people with MS? Professor David Baker, Researcher: Oh, Lemtrada by another name is called Alemtuzumab, yeah? And Alemtuzumab, if you take it apart, so â€˜mabâ€™ means itâ€™s a monoclonal antibody, â€˜alemâ€™ is just the name theyâ€™ve made up, â€˜tuâ€™ means it was originally made to treat cancer. So Alemtuzumabâ€™s a chemotherapy agent, but itâ€™s used to treat multiple sclerosis because we believe that MS is driven by the effect of the T cells and you can get T and B cell cancers, and thatâ€™s where alemtuzumabâ€™s used. So thatâ€™s one. Cladribine, essentially is another one. Mitoxantrone, another one. So thereâ€™s a lot of chemotherapy drugs that have actually been used in MS and they work because they kill active cells and the active cells are the white blood cells. So, yeah. Marlo: Right.

"Hey Everyone- I know I have been quiet lately - frankly there hasn't been a lot of news to report... Current trials are in progress, not too many new ones opening lately. But I continue to watch closely   I expect the news-flow to increase when we hit the big news engines: the AACR & ASCO cancer conferences (especially ASCO) later this spring. I posted a blog today that talks about a crowdfunding effort for a new CRC trial at UCSD. It is based upon a good scientific idea and should be eligible to both KRAS-wt and KRAS-mut. It doses the EGFR inhibitor ""erlotinib"" at very high doses but only 2 days a week, the rest of the week is no treatment. The hypothesis (supported by data so far) is that this ""Cmax drive dosing"" may increase activity as well as decrease skin toxicity - but only doing the CRC trial will tell for sure. I plan to enter it as needed! Crowdfunding is being used to help pay for the trial start since the drug is almost off-patent.

I have at last managed to print your guide to off-label cladribine and see the dose adjustment to avoid grade 4 lymphopaenia is fully explained, thank you. Is grade 3 lymphopaenia with teriflunomide such a bad thing? Maybe not, but is it worth it for the moderate benefit teriflunomide offers when we have better options available?

Like Gilenya, it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes, however, siponimod appears to interact with less of the receptors than Gilenya does â€“ with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors. Siponimod has a relatively short half-life compared to Gilenya, which means that the drug does not stay in the body as long. Researchers hope that these small differences will minimize cardiac issues. In RRMS, results from a Phase II dose-finding study of siponimod were reported in 2012. The trial had a complex design, with the primary goal to determine the most appropriate dose to carry forward into future trials. Approximately 300 people participated in the study. At six months, the proportion of relapse-free patients was 84 percent for the 10 mg group, 92 percent for the 2 mg group, and 77 percent for the 0.5 mg group, as compared to 72 percent in the placebo group. After six months, the ARR (annualized relapse rate) was lower for the individuals who were taking one of the three higher doses. Additionally, regarding MRI parameters, the 2 mg dose reached statistical significance versus placebo, with a reduction in active lesions of approximately 80 percent. Some of the most exciting news in MS research from the last year surrounded the announcement of the results of EXPAND, a Phase III trial of siponimod in SPMS . 18 The trial randomized 1,651 patients with SPMS to siponimod versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio (two times as many patients were given siponimod versus placebo). The primary endpoint of the EXPAND trial was time to three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP). CDP was met when a participant developed an increase in his or her disability that is confirmed by a repeat exam three-months later. This trial was able to show a small, yet statistically significant, decrease in three-month CDP of 21 percent in those on the study drug compared to those on placebo. Participants in the siponimod arm also showed 23.4 percent slower decrease in their brain volume as compared to placebo. However, no difference was observed between the two groups in changes in the timed 25-foot-walk. Relapses were decreased in the group taking siponimod. Overall, patients tolerated the drug well, though more serious adverse events and infections occurred in the siponimod group. Previous: Ofatumumab | Next: Ozanimod",gilenya,2,,,
"infliximab [rmc] Consumer Medicine Information  What is in this leaflet This leaflet answers some common questions about INFLECTRAâ„¢. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist. All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using INFLECTRAâ„¢ against the benefits it is expected to have for you. If you have any concerns about being given this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  What INFLECTRAâ„¢ is used for INFLECTRAâ„¢ contains the active ingredient, infliximab. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is an approved biosimilar medicine. Comparability in safety, efficacy and quality between INFLECTRAâ„¢ and the reference product has been established. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that is produced from human and mouse proteins by recombinant technology. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognise and bind to certain special proteins in the body. Infliximab acts by binding to a special protein in the body called tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±). In people with diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, the body produces too much TNFÎ±, which can cause the body's immune system to attack normal healthy parts of the body. INFLECTRAâ„¢ can block the damage caused by too much TNFÎ±.  Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is used to reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and to prevent damage to the joints. You will also be given a disease-modifying medicine called methotrexate.  Ankylosing Spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease of the spine. INFLECTRAâ„¢ can reduce the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, thereby improving physical function.  Psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints in which psoriasis usually occurs in association with arthritis. Often the fingers and toes are affected, although it may occur in other parts of the body. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is used to reduce the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis and improve the physical function in adults who have not responded well enough to previous treatments with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS). INFLECTRAâ„¢ may be given alone or in combination with methotrexate.  Psoriasis Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is used to treat patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who have not responded well enough to treatments such as phototherapy or conventional systemic treatments, or when these treatments are not appropriate.  Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bowel. It may also affect any part of the gut. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is used to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease in adult patients and in children and adolescent patients (6 to 17 years old) who have not responded well enough to other treatments. INFLECTRAâ„¢ can also reduce the number of abnormal openings from the bowel through the skin (called draining enterocutaneous fistula), a common complication of Crohn's disease.  Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the bowel. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is used to treat the signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis in adult patients and in children and adolescent patients (6 to 17 years old) who have not responded well enough to other treatments. Do not give INFLECTRAâ„¢ to children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis who are younger than 6 years. Do not give INFLECTRAâ„¢ to children and adolescents with any other disease. Your doctor, however, may prescribe INFLECTRAâ„¢ for another purpose. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why INFLECTRAâ„¢ has been prescribed for you.  Before you are given INFLECTRAâ„¢ When you must not be given it Do not use INFLECTRAâ„¢ if you have an allergy to mouse proteins or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction to INFLECTRAâ„¢ may include skin rash, hives, fatigue, wheezing, difficulty in breathing, and/or low blood pressure. Do not use INFLECTRAâ„¢ if you have severe infections such as tuberculosis and infected abscesses, a repeating infection or have had repeating infections. Do not use INFLECTRAâ„¢ if you are already taking another medicine for arthritis, which contains the substance called anakinra. If you have never been given INFLECTRAâ„¢ and have congestive heart failure, you should not use it.  Before you are given it Tell your doctor if you: currently have an infection, or if you are prone to infections, or if you have a history of infections INFLECTRAâ„¢ may affect the normal immune response. You might get infections more easily. Some cases of serious infections, including tuberculosis (TB) and sepsis have been reported in patients treated with INFLECTRAâ„¢. have ever had or been in close contact with TB, even if you were treated for it. have ever had or had been in close contact with hepatitis B Reactivation of hepatitis B have been reported in people treated with TNFÎ± blockers. However, these reports are very rare. have lived in or travelled to an area where fungal infections called histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are common. Ask your doctor if you don't know if these infections are common in the area in which you have lived in or travelled to. These infections are caused by fungus that can affect the lungs or other parts of your body. have had cancer A type of blood cancer called lymphoma has been reported in patients receiving TNF blockers. The reports are rare but are more frequent than expected for people in general. Cancers, other than lymphoma, have also been reported. have a long history of Crohn's disease rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondilitis or psoriatic arthritis, especially if you have a highly active disease and/or have been taking medicine that reduces the activity of the body's natural defences. You may be more likely to develop infections and lymphomas than people in general, even without receiving TNF blockers such as INFLECTRAâ„¢. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant Like most medicines, INFLECTRAâ„¢ is not recommended in pregnancy. You must use adequate contraception to avoid falling pregnant. are breast-feeding Like most medicines, INFLECTRAâ„¢ is not recommended while breast-feeding. It is not known whether INFLECTRAâ„¢ passes into breastmilk. have or have had a disease that affects the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis and seizures, or if you experience any numbness, weakness, tingling, or sight disturbances. suffer from congestive heart failure. Steps must be taken to monitor any changes to your condition during treatment with INFLECTRAâ„¢. have ongoing blood disorders or a history of blood disorders. are scheduled to receive any vaccines Patients receiving INFLECTRAâ„¢ should not receive some types of vaccines. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits of using INFLECTRAâ„¢ against the potential risks.  Taking or being given other medicines Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may affect the way other medicines work. Do not use INFLECTRAâ„¢ if you are already taking another medicine for arthritis, which contains the substance anakinra. Tell your doctor if you are already taking another medicine for arthritis which contains the substance abatacept. Tell your doctor if you are receiving other treatments for rheumatoid arthritis for ankylosing spondilitis for psoriatic arthritis for psoriasis, such as phototherapy or other treatments for Crohn's disease or ulcerative collitis to prevent rejection in organ transplantation. Tell your doctor you are taking INFLECTRAâ„¢ before receiving any vaccinations. Some vaccinations should not be given while you are being treated with INFLECTRAâ„¢. Your doctor or pharmacist will be able to tell you what to do when being given INFLECTRAâ„¢ with other medicines.  How INFLECTRAâ„¢ is given INFLECTRAâ„¢ is only available on prescription. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is given in a drip into a vein (called an infusion) over at least 2 hours. If you were able to tolerate the first 3 two-hour infusions, your doctor may decide to give your next INFLECTRAâ„¢ infusions over a period of not less than 1 hour. For children and adolescents (6-17 years) the infusion is given over at least 2 hours. A period of observation follows treatment.  Rheumatoid arthritis The recommended starting dose is an infusion of 3 mg/kg. You will get additional doses of 3 mg/kg at 2 and 6 weeks after your first infusion and then every 8 weeks after that. If, after 12 weeks of treatment, your arthritis does not respond well enough to the 3 mg/kg dose, your doctor may decide to gradually increase your dose to a maximum of 7.5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. You will also be taking methotrexate as part of your treatment.  Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended starting dose is an infusion of 5 mg/kg. You will get additional doses of 5 mg/kg at 2 and 6 weeks after your first infusion and then every 6 weeks after that.  Psoriatic arthritis The recommended starting dose is an infusion of 5 mg/kg. You will receive additional doses of 5 mg/kg at 2 and 6 weeks after your first infusion, then every 8 weeks after that. INFLECTRAâ„¢ may be given alone or in combination with methotrexate.  Psoriasis The recommended starting dose is an infusion of 5 mg/kg. You will get additional doses of 5 mg/kg at 2 and 6 weeks after your first infusion, and then every 8 weeks after that.  Crohn's disease The recommended starting dose for Crohn's disease in adults and in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years); and for closure of fistula in adult patients is an initial infusion of 5 mg/kg followed by additional doses of 5 mg/kg at 2 and 6 weeks after your first infusion, and then every 8 weeks after that. In some cases, your doctor may decide to increase your dose up to 10 mg/kg.  Ulcerative colitis The recommended starting dose for ulcerative colitis in adults and in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years) is an infusion of 5 mg/kg. You will get additional doses of 5 mg/kg at 2 and 6 weeks after your first infusion, and then every 8 weeks after that.  While you are being given INFLECTRAâ„¢ Things you must do Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if the medicine starts to upset you or your symptoms become worse. Tell your doctor or dentist that you are being treated with INFLECTRAâ„¢ before you undergo any surgical procedures. Tell your doctor: if symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, fever), or any other infection appear. Do this immediately. if symptoms of hepatitis B (upset stomach, loss of appetite, vomiting, tiredness, dark yellow or brown urine, and yellow eyes or skin) appear. You must do this immediately. that you are taking INFLECTRAâ„¢ before receiving any vaccinations. Some vaccinations should not be given while you are being treated with INFLECTRAâ„¢. You should continue to take adequate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy. Your doctor will also advise you not to breastfeed.  Things to be careful of Tell your doctor if you think you have an infection. INFLECTRAâ„¢ may affect the normal immune response. There is a possibility that you may be more prone to infections. You will be watched closely for signs of infection. Tell your doctor immediately if you develop a skin rash or hives. Your doctor may discontinue INFLECTRAâ„¢ until the symptoms go away and then begin giving the medicine again. Symptoms will resolve with appropriate treatment. If you suffer from congestive heart failure, tell your doctor immediately if your condition worsens. INFLECTRAâ„¢ is unlikely to make you drowsy. If you are tired, do not drive a car or work with machinery.  Side effects Tell your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are being given INFLECTRAâ„¢. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects. Generally, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, or psoriasis already take several medicines to treat their disease. These medicines may themselves cause side effects. If you get additional side effects or any new symptoms, please tell your doctor. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. Do not be alarmed by the following list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them. During the infusion of INFLECTRAâ„¢ the following reactions may occur: fever or chills itchiness or hives chest pain low blood pressure high blood pressure shortness of breath These reactions are more likely to occur during the first and second infusion but may also appear up to six months after the last infusion. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following: pain or tenderness in chest, muscles, joints or jaw swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, face, lips, mouth or throat, which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing fever muscle pains joint pains tiredness abnormal chest sounds rash itching symptoms that may indicate heart failure, e.g. shortness of breath, especially with exercise or lying down, or swelling of your feet. Tell your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if you notice any of the following: headache nausea or vomiting dizziness and light-headedness fatigue fever rash hives itching sore throat coughing hoarseness shortness of breath chest pain back pain muscle pain abdominal pain indigestion diarrhoea weight loss, muscle wasting problems with urination changes in the way your heart beats, for example, if you notice it beating faster flushing dry skin or increased sweating fluid retention new onset of psoriasis, mainly on the soles of the feet and on palms worsening of rheumatoid arthritis. There have been very rare cases where people taking INFLECTRAâ„¢ have developed liver problems. Signs that you could be having a problem include: jaundice (skin and eyes turning yellow) dark-brown coloured urine right-sided abdominal pain fever severe fatigue (tiredness). You should contact your doctor immediately if you develop any of these symptoms. Tell your doctor if you notice any other effects. Most of the side effects are mild to moderate in severity. Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. Some side effects may appear up to six months after the last infusion.  Cancers In clinical studies, more cancers were seen in patients who received TNF-blockers, including INFLECTRAâ„¢, than patients who did not receive these treatments. In children and adults being treated with TNF-blockers, the chances of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. It should be noted, however, that patients with longstanding and active rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease may already have a higher risk for developing cancers even without TNF-blockers, making it difficult to estimate the risk of developing cancers in these patients. Nevertheless, the role of TNFblockers in the development of cancers cannot be excluded. A rare type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL) has been reported rarely in adolescents and young adults with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis who have received INFLECTRAâ„¢. All of these patients were also receiving drugs known as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. No cases of HSTCL have been reported in patients receiving INFLECTRAâ„¢ only. HSTCL often results in death. The role of TNF blockers in the development of cancers in children and adolescents remain unclear. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned about this. Skin cancers (melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) have been reported rarely in patients treated with TNFblockers, including INFLECTRAâ„¢. Tell your doctor if you notice any new skin lesions during or after therapy or if existing lesions change appearance. Patients with a lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and who have a history of heavy smoking may have an increased risk for getting cancer while being treated with INFLECTRAâ„¢.  After INFLECTRAâ„¢ has been stopped Tell your doctor immediately if: you notice any of the following side effects, even if they occur several weeks after stopping treatment with INFLECTRAâ„¢. - skin rash or hives - frequent infections symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, fever), or any other infection appear. symptoms of hepatitis B (upset stomach, loss of appetite, vomiting, tiredness, dark yellow or brown urine, and yellow eyes or skin) appear. These symptoms may appear several months after your last INFLECTRAâ„¢ treatment. You should continue to take adequate contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months after the last infusion of INFLECTRAâ„¢. Your doctor will advise you not to breastfeed for at least 6 months after your last infusion of INFLECTRAâ„¢. Tell your doctor if you notice any other effects.  Storage INFLECTRAâ„¢ should be stored at 2Â°C to 8Â°C (Refrigerate.) Do not use beyond the expiry date. INFLECTRAâ„¢ vials are for single use only. Any unused portion should be discarded.

"Hi, Dr. West, We heard so much about your expertise in BAC lung cancer.  We would like to ask you some questions.  Please help!  To save your time, I make her story short. In July 2011, my wife had stage IB lung cancer.  She was 46 years old then.  She is eastern Asian, non smoker.  She had her right upper lobe removed. The single tumor was 3.2 cm.  Pathology report stated that her cancer was adenocarcinoma mixed subtype (papillary, bronchioloalveolar, and acinar), well differentiated,  visceral pleural invasion present.  All lymph nodes are negative. Nowhere else had cancer. She finished 4 rounds of cisplatin/alimta chemotherapy in November 2011.  She had follow up CT or PET Scans every year since 2012. In February 2015, CT discovered that she had a new 7mm nodule at right lower lobe.  Then the nodule was measured at 6mm in April 2015 PET Scan and July 2015 CT,  9mm in January 2016 PET Scan, 6mm in February 2016 CT and 10mm in June 2016 CT.  Two new smaller nodules (both 3mm) at right lower lobe were discovered in June 2016 CT, too.  We had a biopsy in July and pathology confirmed that the big nodule is the same cancer as in year 2011. Her doctor recommends Tarceva as next therapy. Given the history above, I have the following questions: Does my wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adenocarcinoma have BAC features? Is her lung cancer considered slow growing? Is Tarceva the best therapy she should have now? Do you think you can help her and she needs to schedule appointment to see you? Many Thanks!",tarceva,2,,,
"In December 2016, the New England Journal of Medicine published the spectacular results from a pair of major international clinical trials led by Hauser, confirming that ocrelizumab can block the inflammation that drives the disease. The trials, known as OPERA I and OPERA II, compared the effectiveness and safety of ocrelizumab to that of interferon beta-1a, the current standard treatment for relapsing-remitting MS. Ocrelizumab cut annual relapse rates by 47 percent, reduced disability by 43 percent and shrank inflammatory lesions in the brain by 95 percent compared to interferon. A separate clinical trial, known as ORATORIO, found that ocrelizumab could modestly slow the advance of primary progressive MS, which until now has been resistant to treatment. These Phase III trials have shown that ocrelizumab, an antibody that targets the CD20 molecule on the surface of B cells, is extremely effective for relapsing-remitting MS, which is caused by B cells circulating in the blood and bound for the nervous system where they orchestrate inflammation. These B cells â€“ about 2 percent of the B cells in the body â€“ are destroyed reliably and for several months with each dose of ocrelizumab treatment, which is given by infusion every six months. The trials were sponsored by F. Hoffman-La Roche (Roche), the company that holds the patent on ocrelizumab. â€œThe availability of a highly effective and well-tolerated treatment means that people at the dawn of their MS can be treated with a therapy that will essentially completely block the inflammation in myelin that causes relapses and remission,â€ said Hauser, chair of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences . â€œAnd we are optimistic that by doing so, the outlook over many years will be even more favorable than it is today.â€ Researchers believe that primary progressive MS is caused by the other 98 percent of our B cells that live in protected areas within brain tissue. Ocrelizumab is only modestly effective at targeting these hidden B cells. But it is nonetheless the first therapy to have any effect on primary progressive MS.  Hope for Patients Approval of ocrelizumab could mean a new outlook for patients such as Sarah Warto, one of Hauserâ€™s patients. Diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS as a college student more than a decade ago, Warto has experienced several bouts of disease symptoms that have ranged from impaired depth perception to difficulty walking. Her most recent flare-up occurred after sheâ€™d given birth to her daughter two years ago. â€œI had a fairly severe attack that really limited my ability to use my leg. I could walk for a minute, and then after a minute it was like a totally different person had taken over my body,â€ she said. With ocrelizumab on the horizon, she dreams of a future free of relapses, especially as she thinks of having a second child.  Finding a Better Model The approval of ocrelizumab marks a shift in the treatment of MS that has been several decades in the making and one that has overcome many hurdles. Just 15 years ago, Hauser and his colleagues were told by the National Institutes of Health that his proposal to test a B-cell-targeting MS drug lacked â€œbiological plausibility.â€ At the time, it was still widely accepted that another type of immune cell, known as T cells, were the culprits behind MS â€“ an idea based on an inaccurate mouse model of the disease. In the mice, researchers could transmit an MS-like condition from one animal to another simply by transferring T cells, but the underlying tissue changes in the mice did not closely resemble those in human MS. Nevertheless, most researchers shrugged off the discrepancy and continued to rely on these models. When Hauser started his own laboratory at Harvard University in 1986, he set out to find a model of MS that had more fidelity to the human disease. This work continued after he moved to UCSF in 1992 to become professor and chair of the Department of Neurology. After many years of setbacks, Hauser in the mid-1990s, together with postdoctoral fellows Luca Massacesi and Claude Genain, developed a new animal model that replicated the behavioral and tissue changes seen in human MS. The new model led to what Hauser calls their first eureka moment: when they saw antibodies tightly bound to the degenerating myelin proteins. These were the same antibodies that could be detected in the spinal fluid of patients with MS, and had long been used as a diagnostic marker for MS â€“ yet considered to be insignificant to the disease mechanism because they were produced by B cells rather than T cells. Here they were, clearly complicit in the disease. In the new animal model, researchers found they could transmit the MS-like condition from one animal to another only if they transferred antibodies and B cells along with T cells. â€œThis was a paradigm change for the field,â€ said Hauser. He and his team now believed that antibodies working alongside T cells were key to the myelin destruction. It would be another couple of years before they realized they still hadnâ€™t hit the nail on the head.  A Second Eureka Moment As a clinician-scientist, Hauser was eager to apply their laboratory discoveries toward a new therapy. He and colleagues wrote a grant to the NIH, proposing to test an existing cancer drug, rituximab, that targeted B cells and had been approved for B cell lymphoma. They hoped that in MS patients, the B-cell killing drug would stop the production of antibodies causing the inflammation. The NIH dismissed their proposal, suggesting they would be funded only if they switched to a T-cell therapy. â€œWe were devastated,â€ said Hauser. â€œBut we were not ready to quit.â€ In 2001, he approached Genentech, the maker of rituximab, and after 18 months of discussions and what everyone acknowledged were low chances of success, they began a preliminary trial that would allow them to test one dose of the drug. Because antibodies are not produced directly by B cells, but by long-living intermediate cells known as plasma cells that would not be directly targeted by the drug, Hauser and his team believed it would take several doses of the drug to eliminate the antibodies. â€œWe were hoping that with one dose we would see a tiny little effect that would give us courage to embark on longer studies,â€ said Hauser. Instead, they saw an effect far more dramatic than they imagined. â€œThere was an almost immediate and nearly complete blockade of all new inflammation in the people who had received the drug,â€ said Hauser. The stunning results after just one dose told them two things. â€œFirst that we had something that was likely to help many hundreds of thousands of people, and second that the science that had driven the experiments was wrong,â€ said Hauser. It was almost certainly not the antibodies instigating the nerve damage, a process that wouldâ€™ve taken longer to reverse, but the B cells themselves.  Importance of Clinician-Scientists Crosstalk between bench and bedside was key to solving the mystery of MS, and clinician-scientists like Hauser are essential conduits. â€œClinician-scientists are always working in two areas,â€ he said. â€œWe want to understand as deeply as possible the cause of the disease weâ€™re studying, and we also feel responsible for driving that understanding forward for better therapies today.â€ A few years later, Genentech, by then acquired by Roche, developed ocrelizumab, a newer B-cell targeting drug designed to be safer and easier to administer. That set the drug on the path for clinical studies and, ultimately, approval for patients. â€œMy hope is that ocrelizumab will make a life-changing difference for many hundreds of thousands of people with MS today, and many more who may develop MS in the future,â€ said Hauser.",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"Ken - As a disinterested but interested third party reader, I would encourage you to keep getting the medicine. First, it's seemingly keeping you alive, which is a damn good thing, I'm sure your family will agree and second, from an altruistic perspective, you are contributing your trial to those who will follow. If they will allow you to continue and you experience no adverse issues that would force you off of this, my counsel would be to continue. I say this based on having read your entire blog and my understanding of your path but also with a somewhat detached (can I really be that detached when I am also fighting BCa????) view from 'outside in'. NB: I am not an ethicist, simply a reader. The alternative isn't that great, and as with any of these therapies, what doesn't kill you may not in fact make you stronger.

"A treatment combination has been provisionally rejected for people with certain types of lung cancer on the NHS in England. The decision will be reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) at the end of March. The combination included four drugs: the immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq), a targeted drug called bevacizumab (Avastin) , plus two chemotherapies, carboplatin (Paraplatin) and paclitaxel (Taxol) . NICE reviewed the combination for patients with a type of lung cancer called non-squamous non small cell lung cancer. It was being assessed for those with advanced disease or in those whose cancer cells carried one of two genetic faults. Cancer Research UKâ€™s policy manager, Rose Gray, said it was a shame that NICE provisionally rejected this treatment. â€œLung cancer survival is lower than many other types of cancer and so itâ€™s crucial that we find new, effective treatment options for people with this disease.â€ Patients with these cancers are currently given a combination of chemotherapy drugs.  Combo not cost effective The combination with atezolizumab significantly prolonged the amount of time a patientâ€™s disease was stable and how long they lived in a clinical trial, compared to a group receiving the combination minus atezolizumab. But NICE said the study did not compare the treatment combination with the current standard of care, so its overall benefits are unknown. NICE also disagreed with how the long-term survival of patients with the genetic faults was calculated. Because of this the combination couldnâ€™t be considered cost-effective on the NHS.  The trial The study in question included 1,040 patients with non small cell lung cancer who received one of three different combinations of the drugs.  bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel atezolizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel Patientsâ€™ lung cancers remained stable for around one and a half months longer on average if they received all four drugs, compared to those receiving bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. The four-drug combination also boosted survival. Patients lived around four and a half months longer on average than those taking bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. Side effects were slightly worse in the group taking the four drugs. They reported more cases of symptoms such as a rash, loss of appetite and fever.  The drugs The drugs in the combination attack the cancer in different ways. Atezolizumab is an immunotherapy that blocks a molecule often found in excess on the surface of cancer cells. The molecule, called PD-L1, tells immune cells not to attack the cancer cell. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab may unveil cancer cells to the immune system so they can be attacked and destroyed. Bevacizumab targets a different molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that helps cancers to grow blood vessels. By attacking the growth of blood vessels, the drug can stop the cancer from gathering food and oxygen from the blood.",avastin,2,,,
"Hi guys... Quick backstory. I was diagnosed at 17 and Iâ€™m now 26. Iâ€™ve only had one 6 month period of remission in that time. I have severe pan colitis . I have been on Uceris and Prednisone, which I now have a resistance to. They have ZERO impact on my condition other than systemic side effects. Iâ€™m allergic to mesalamines. Saw no results with Imuran/6mp/mercaptopurine. In December 2017, I was hospitalized, lost a severe amount of weight, colon was so inflammated that it was causing a blockage etc. I started Humira during that time and began to saw a little Relief but it was very short lived. Began flaring fairly quickly. I then started Remicade. I am now going on my 5th infusion. I get them every 6 weeks and Iâ€™m at the â€œdoubledâ€ dose. I feel better almost immediately. I go from 10-15 BMs a day down to 1-2 BMs however itâ€™s still always urgent, and diarrhea.. Unfortunately the infusion effects on last about 2-3 weeks and I begin flaring and waiting for my next dose.. My doctor says Iâ€™m at the max dosage of Remicade I can receive.. She opted to start me on Mercaptopurine again to see if they would work better together. So my question is, when would you ditch the Remicade and start a new biologic? Is it normal for it to work, but only for a few weeks? Is having diarrhea still even tho I feel mostly better normal? Has anyone else experienced something similar ?

"Hi Jim, Thanks for the reply and affirmation that my thoughts for options moving forward are reasonable. Just wondering would it be possible for a doctor on this forum to just make a comment on what options they would consider for their own patients, who present similarly as my mom, given her cancer history? I am under the suspicion from conversations last week that the onc is not likely considering rechallenging with Tagrisso because of the issues with drug induced pneumonitis. When asked about Afatinib or immunotherapy, he mentioned that any generation TKIs and immunotherapy could also induce a similar side effect. Given this, what other options are we to consider that would help control her disease in the brain, bones, and lungs?? Is the risk not justified by the fact that there is just no other viable treatment options available? On a side note, mom has never had any lines of conventional IV chemotherapy â€“ would this be a viable option? I read in literature that chemo tends to only extend life by a couple months and tends to not work well on the brain or leptomeningeal disease. Is this accurate? If so, is it at least worth trying out on how she responds and if there is no clinical response in the short run, then retry TKI therapy (e.g., Afatinib?). Or is it more wise to pursue rechallenging TKI or immunotherapy or some other therapy I havenâ€™t thought of? Really confused and looking forward to any help and guidance possible.

"Nearly half of patients on ocrelizumab achieved no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) by Kristina Fiore Associate Editor, MedPage Today VANCOUVER -- The investigational B-cell monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab beat out interferon at stifling disease activity in multiple sclerosis over 2 years, researchers reported here. In the OPERA I & II trials, with a significantly larger proportion of patients on the experimental treatment achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) (48% versus 29% and 25%, respectively), Anthony Traboulsee, MD, of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, reported at the American Academy of Neurology meeting here. Ocrelizumab is an anti-CD20+ monoclonal antibody targeting B-cells. Most available immunosuppresive therapies for MS target T-cells, but researchers now theorize that B-cells may also play an important role in MS. In fact, ocrelizumab would not be the first B-cell targeting therapy used in MS. Some physicians currently use rituximab off-label to treat the condition. Both rituximab and ocrelizumab are made by Roche/Genentech, which had tested rituximab in both progressive and relapsing-remitting MS with promising results before deciding not to fund further trials. Researchers said that while rituximab is chimeric, ocrelizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds more tightly to its target than the older drug, so infusion reactions and anti-drug antibody responses may be lessened. NEDA in RRMS In OPERA I & II, NEDA was a composite of no relapses, no confirmed disability progression, no new or enlarging gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions, and no new or enlarging T2 lesions. Patients were randomized to ocrelizumab 600-mg infusion every 24 weeks or to interferon beta three times a week for 96 weeks. Investigators previously reported a reduction in the annualized relapse rate with ocrelizumab in both trials compared with interferon, with a 46% relative reduction in OPERA I and a 47% relative reduction in OPERA II. In the latest analysis, they found that significantly more ocrelizumab patients achieved NEDA compared with those treated with interferon (48% versus 29% in OPERA I and 48% versus 25% in OPERA II). That translated to a 64% to 89% relative increase in preventing disease activity (P<0.0001 for both), Traboulsee said. When breaking down NEDA by individual component, larger proportions of those on ocrelizumab were: ~Without relapses: about 80% versus 65% ~Without 12-week confirmed disability progression: about 90% versus 85% ~Without gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions: 90% versus 65% ~Without new or enlarging T2 lesions: 60% versus 38% ""Ocrelizumab for relapsing MS is an extremely important step forward,"" David Hafler, MD, of Yale University, who was not involved in the study, told MedPage Today. ""The risk of progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy seems to be relatively low. It appears to be, by MRI criteria, the most effective treatment yet."" Hafler said MS clinicians will probably use it as a first-line drug, as long as the safety profile ""remains as we've seen."" Raghav Govindarajan, MD, of the University of Missouri, who was also not involved in the study, called the drug ""very promising"" for relapsing MS. ""This changes the way we think about MS as a disease,"" he told MedPage Today. ""Other medications like natalizumab work on T cells, and that is how we have predominantly thought about MS."" No New PPMS Data Researchers also reported the results of the 732-patient ORATORIO trial during a poster session, but these were not much different from those previously reported at ECTRIMS in Barcelona, Traboulsee said. The drug reduced the relative risk of 12-week clinical disability progression by 24% (HR 0.76, P=0.0321). The trial enrolled younger patients who'd had a shorter duration of progressive disease than in past progressive MS trials. ""This is the first treatment to crack open the door to show that progressive MS is treatable,"" Traboulsee told MedPage Today. ""Now that we know that the treatment works -- partially, but it works -- we can now better explore why it works and we can improve on that so we get a bigger impact on patients."" Traboulsee noted that ""everything is more effective in relapsing MS because we understand the mechanisms better. We are still struggling to figure out why people progress."" Hafler said the effect seen in the ORATORIO trial ""was modest at best. We badly need to understand PPMS in its varied forms. Yes, it will probably get approved, and yes, we will use it, but we need to do better."" Govindarajan said it will be an improvement that he will be able to offer progressive MS patients something that has been shown to treat their condition, not just co-occurring symptoms. ""Right now all I can do is provide support,"" he said. ""I don't have much to offer. I can get them a wheelchair. I can give Botox for the spasticity. I can help them with swallowing. But if this medication is shown to work, it can make a difference for these patients."" A Familiar Situation It remains to be seen whether ocrelizumab beats out rituximab at slowing disease activity in MS, although this is a trial that isn't likely to be done given that Roche/Genentech manufacture both products. The companies are no strangers to having two competing drugs for a single condition, with one offered at a significantly cheaper price. Roche/Genentech manufacture both bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis) for a host of ophthalmic conditions, and physicians have long preferred the less costly bevacizumab, especially after studies largely showed equal efficacy and safety profiles between the two. Whether such a situation will arise with rituximab-ocrelizumab remains speculative, but biosimilars for rituximab are expected to be introduced eventually, at which point market pressures may force Roche/Genentech to drop the price for rituximab. _________________ Traboulsee disclosed financial relationships with Biogen, Hoffman-LaRoche, Genzyme, Serono, and Teva.",ocrelizumab,0,,,

"Liquid biopsies have been the focus of intense research and, a group of experts impaneled by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) reported in March, â€œstudies of multiple cancer types indicate that ctDNA analysis can identify the emergence of resistant mutations months earlier than standard radiologic studies, creating an opportunity to test whether changing therapy before clinical progression could improve outcomes.â€ 3 Advances in genomic analysis have aided the progress of the blood tests, but several factors pose challenges. â€œAvailable evidence indicates that patients with early-stage cancers can harbor less than one mutant template molecule per milliliter of plasma,â€ the CancerSEEK paper's authors stated, â€œwhich is often beyond the limit of detection of previously reported technologies that assess multiple mutations simultaneously. Yet another issue with liquid biopsies is the identification of the underlying tissue of origin. Because the same gene mutations drive multiple tumor types, liquid biopsies based on genomic analysis alone generally cannot identify the anatomical location of the primary tumor.â€ Therefore, while ASCO/CAP panel recognized the promising results of research thus far, they cautioned that blood tests based on ctDNA require much more extensive and broad-based clinical trials before they can be used in routine practice.  Related Articles Liquid Biopsy May Accurately Detect Genomic Mutations in Urothelial Carcinoma NSCLC: Tissue, Rather Than Liquid, Biopsy Recommended for Identifying Resistance Mechanisms â€œThere is no evidence of clinical utility and little evidence of clinical validity of ctDNA assays in early-stage cancer, treatment monitoring, or residual disease detection,â€ the authors said. â€œThere is no evidence of clinical validity or clinical utility to suggest that ctDNA assays are useful for cancer screening, outside of a clinical trial.â€ However, as the National Cancer Institute said in an article on its website last November, â€œThere has been a recent surge of research related to liquid biopsy tests that analyze tumor DNA in blood, called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and several ctDNA-based liquid biopsy tests are in clinical development.â€ 4 In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave approval to a blood-based cancer test for the first time just 2 years ago. The cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 can detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and help identify those who â€œmay benefit from treatment with [erlotinib].â€ 5 However, the FDA advised, â€œif such mutations are not detected in the blood, then a tumor biopsy should be performed to determine if the NSCLC mutations are present.â€ â€œApprovals of liquid biopsy tests make it possible to deliver highly individualized health care for patients,â€ Alberto Gutierrez, PhD, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health in Silver Spring, Maryland, explained at the time. â€œLiquid biopsies also have the potential to allow physicians to identify patients whose tumors have specific mutations in the least invasive way possible.â€ The accelerated pace of research is bringing new evidence supporting the use of liquid biopsies in a variety of ways and quickly addressing some of the concerns. As one of the members of the ASCO/CAP panel, Alexander Lazar, MD, PhD, FCAP, of the departments of pathology and genomic medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said via email, â€œThe field of liquid biopsies is moving very rapidly. Our comments in the manuscript were based on the literature at the time we discussed and wrote the review â€” almost a year ago. Because of the excitement and work of many in this field, there is more published literature supporting the use of this approach. Using liquid biopsies results to determine therapy for a positive result is clinically feasible; if a mutation is present, acting upon it is reasonable. There is less certainty regarding clinical action on negative results, that is, not seeing a particular mutation. â€¦ However,â€ he continued, â€œwith each study published we are learning how to better apply these tests effectively.â€ References",erlotinib,2,,,

"Iâ€™ve been following you for some time. Iâ€™ve read every post, but I havenâ€™t commented until now. I have been on Ocrevus since December of 2017. I â€” like you â€” canâ€™t say that it has helped me. In fact, I have more problems now. To summarize my experienced with Ocrevus, my second half of my first infusion caused an anaphylactic reaction. I was able to continue on the medication after the rate was lowered and a bag of saline was administered concurrently with the medication. I had immediate headaches after the infusion, my walking somewhat improved, but then declined over the months, and the swelling in my lower legs and feet were horrible. I started having problems regulating my temperature during the day (Iâ€™m always cold), but during the night I have night sweats. I had my hormones tested, but they were normal. I knew this had something to do with Ocrevus. Things really started to decline when I went in for my next infusion in August 2018. I came home from the infusion to discover I started my menstrual cycle. It didnâ€™t stop until January 15 of this year. After tests were done, it was confirmed I had fibroids in my uterus and cysts on my ovaries. The reason I stopped a week ago is because I had a total hysterectomy. Now Iâ€™m awaiting the news of the pathology to see if any cancer was found.

There are a lot of women who discuss the same thing weâ€™re both going through. Like you, I was also on Rituxan prior to O. I canâ€™t say right now if I would consider going back on that or not. Iâ€™be tried just about every DMD other than Gilenya or Lemtrada (another name for Campath). Quite frankly, those two scare me more than what Iâ€™m going through now.

Paper didn't include a breakdown by subset as to progression free survival rates. Would love to know which patients fared best, but I didn't see that data available. Given the burgeoning HSCT medical tourism industry, which is not excluding patients with progressive disease, some larger, more robust studies on the efficacy of HSCT in patients with various forms of progressive MS are urgently needed. If this treatment can induce years of stability in patients who otherwise would see disability progression, the MS community urgently needs to know this info. If HSCT only works on patients with progressive ms who display active inflammatory markers, this also needs to be shown. Given the moderate effects of Ocrevus on even progressive patients with active inflammatory markers, a treatment modality that can put a halt to progression for years at a time warrants robust investigation.",ocrevus,0,,,
My husband has BAC with mucus with no mutations. He is 62 years old. I have read Dr West is well known about BAC. My husband is suffering from the bronchorrhea from this type of cancer.

"Osimertinib prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with earlier-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) â€” regardless of the level of PD-L1 tumor expressionâ€”among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , according to an analysis of the phase 3 FLAURA trial presented at the IASLC's 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto, Canada. 1 Results from the trial demonstrated that osimertinib prolonged PFS compared with gefitinib or erlotinib in patients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC. The effect of PD-L1 expression, which is frequently expressed in tumors with EGFR mutations, on EGFR TKIs is unknown. Of the 556 patients randomly assigned to treatment in the study, 106 (19%) harbored an EGFR mutation and had sufficient tissue for PD-L1 assessment. The SP296 (Ventana) immunohistochemistry test was used to evaluate PD-L1 tumor expression, and tumor cell (TC) staining of at least 1% was considered positive.  Related Articles Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy Extended Survival Longer Than Chemotherapy Alone: Study In a Head-to-Head Battle, Brigatinib Appears to Best Crizotinib Durvalumab Shows Overall Survival Benefit in Patients With Stage III NSCLC There was no significant difference in median PFS between among patients with positive versus negative PD-L1 tumor expression who received osimertinib. Treatment with osimertinib resulted in a median PFS of 18.4 compared with 6.9 months with gefitinib or erlotinib among patients whose tumors were PD-L1 positive (hazard ratio [HR], 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.60). Similarly, the median PFS among patients whose tumors were negative for PD-L1 expression was 18.9 months with osimertinib compared with 10.9 months with gefitinib or erlotinib (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.74). The authors concluded that these data â€œsupport the efficacy of the EGFR-TKIs, including osimertinib, as first-line treatment of EGFR -mutated advanced NSCLC, irrespective of PD-L1 expression.â€ Read more of Cancer Therapy Advisor 's coverage of the IASLC 2018 meeting by visiting the conference page .

This was back in July 2013. Was on for about 14 months and had a mixed response.  Attempted to get on the Aura trial back in Nov. 2014.  She was rejected because she had previously received a kidney transplant and was on certain anti-rejection/immunosuppressants meds.   They did three rounds of carboplatin/pemetrexed and then maintenance pemetrexed ever few weeks until about three or four months ago since she was in the hospital 3 times with pneumonia.  They stopped, not because the pemetrexed stopped working but due to the complicationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.cancer progressed and tube inserted to assist with fluidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦seems to have helped.

This was yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s news.  Dr., also indicate that biopsy seemed to show even less pronouncement of prior EGFR mutations. Sorry for the long winded start, but my MIL is on various anti-rejection/immunosuppressants meds because she had a kidney transplant in November 2007. Sounds like without being positive for the T790 mutation, the options for her are limited.  Dr. plans to try three rounds of pemetrexed on its own and see what the response is. The next option after that was taxotere? Dr. said this is much stronger and could have more side effects. Just wondering if there are options out there for those on immunosuppressants other than the current course? Dr. wanted to get in touch with the transplant/kidney Dr. to discussion options.

The trial was testing Entyvio as a maintenance therapy for adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who are responding well to Entyvio. The results showed that significantly more patients receiving the SC formulation of vedolizumab achieved clinical remission at week 52 versus placebo. In addition, the safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of Entyvio, which is already marketed in an intravenous form, and no new safety signals were identified.

"Results from two early-phase clinical trials presented at the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting provide further evidence that priming the immune system to attack tumors has potential as a treatment for certain cancers. The findings were also published June 2, 2012, in the New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM , here and here ). Although preliminary, the results are notable because, in both trials, the treatments produced substantial tumor shrinkage in some patients with  non-small cell lung cancer , which has been extremely resistant to immune-based therapies thus far, the trial leaders explained. And in many of these patients, the tumor responses were maintained for a year or more. ""I think it's one of the most exciting things I've seen in recent years,"" said D. Ross Camidge, M.D., Ph.D., a lung cancer researcher at the University of Colorado Denver, who was not involved in either study. ""A lot of the progress we've made recently has been about identifying molecular subtypes of lung cancer and having very specific targeted treatments. The promise of immunotherapy is something that actually cuts across some of those boundaries and may change every single treatment paradigm that we're currently developing."" Both studies tested  investigational drugs that target molecules known as ""checkpoint"" molecules, which help restrain immune responses so they don't harm the body. Tumors can co-opt these checkpoint molecules, weakening the immune system's ability to eradicate the tumors. Tumor shrinkage was also seen in patients with melanoma and kidney cancer . Previous studies have shown that these cancers can respond to immunotherapy, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved immunotherapies for patients with these tumors. In addition, one of 17 patients with ovarian cancer who received one of the investigational drugs also had a tumor response.  Unleashing the Immune Response The two drugs tested in the trials are  monoclonal antibodies , one of which targets a receptor protein known as PD-1 on the surface of activated  T cells . The other drug targets a binding partner (ligand) of PD-1, called PD-L1, which is expressed at higher than normal levels on many tumors and on cells in the  tumor microenvironment in response to inflammatory stimuli. Both agents are being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which was the primary funder of both trials. In 2011, the FDA approved the first checkpoint molecule inhibitor, ipilimumab (Yervoyâ„¢) to treat advanced melanoma. Ipilimumab, however, targets a different checkpoint molecule, CTLA-4, on the surface of activated T cells. Patients in the trials also had stomach , breast , colorectal ,  castration -resistant prostate , or pancreatic tumors that grew despite multiple prior treatments. Nearly 300 patients were enrolled in the trial testing the PD-1 targeted agent, and slightly more than 200 were enrolled in the trial testing the PD-L1 targeted agent. Both trials tested escalating doses of the drugs, starting with a low dose. If no significant side effects were seen, the researchers incrementally increased the doses for patients who enrolled later. The results are intriguing not only because of the number of the responses but also because of their durability, noted Suzanne Topalian, M.D., of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who led the trial testing the PD-1 targeted agent. Among 31 patients who responded to the PD-1 targeted agent and were followed for at least one year, 20 had responses that persisted for at least a year.",yervoy,2,,,
"I have also been switched to the generic and before starting, I wanted to see how everyone else was doing. I still have a couple of weeks worth of Lialda. Been on it without issue since 2009. My 90 day supply was only $30 co-pay and when I picked up my script from CVS it was only $15. I didn't realize I was switched until I got home, thought my doc only renewed for 45 days as I'm due to see her soon. Just started a mild flare. Fun how this disease just keeps us guessing! I will post with results if I have any problems with the generic.   Lgreco New Member Joined : Sep 2017 Posts : 5 Posted Yesterday 12:19 PM (GMT -6) Now that the Lialda savings card is over, I'm afraid generic may be my only option moving forward. For the past week, I've been taking half generic, half Lialda to test it out. No noticeable difference besides more frequent BM, but I've also upped fiber in my diet.   UCinGV Regular Member Joined : Mar 2007 Posts : 404 Posted Yesterday 2:30 PM (GMT -6) My employer is trying to push everyone into HSA/HDHP plans and phasing out their PPO starting at the end of 2019. The big problem with this for me, of course, is buying Lialda out of pocket. Currently my PPO is charging me $40 and paying $1124. (I also found out I was switched to the generic without me noticing. Before three months ago I was paying $250 and insurance paid $1296.) So, in anticipation of being pushed into an HSA plan, I started looking at these prices. Someone showed me this app called ""GoodRX"" where you can find the place with the cheapest prices. This app says that 180 pills of generic Lialda ""Mesalamine DR"" is $1100 at Costco (close to what I'm paying with my insurance company's mail order) and $463 at Walmart. Can that be right? Is there that big of a difference in prices or is the drug at Walmart different? Before I go down there and buy some, how can I be sure that any ""generic Lialda"" I am buying has the same delivery mechanism as brand name Lialda? Is ""Mesalamine DR"" the official generic name for Lialda with the delivery mechanism of Lialda?   iPoop Forum Moderator Joined : Aug 2012 Posts : 13436 Posted Yesterday 3:27 PM (GMT -6) Zydus Pharmaceuticals produces both generic-lialda and generic-asacohd. www.zydususa.com/product-details/?id=307 www.zydususa.com/product-details/?id=216 Moderator Ulcerative Colitis John , 39, UC Proctosigmoiditis Rx: Remicade @5mgs/kg/6wks; daily 75mgs 6MP, 4.8g generic-Lialda, and rowasa Told my dentist I'd rather see him than my gasteroenteroligist.

Glasw55 New Member Joined : Apr 2012 Posts : 8 Posted Today 9:53 PM (GMT -6) Has anyone that has been on Lialda and in remission had success taking the generic brand? I can't afford to have a flare, last flare was horrific and caused me permanent damage to my spine due to side effects of Prednisone, and I don't want to go on Humira or any other serious drug. Don't think that taking these drugs are without risk. I've been on Lialda for 4+ years and it has been keeping me stable, took Asacol before that and flared every year. The release system of Lialda differentiates how it works compared with Asacol. They are both Mesalamine but work completely different in how the medicastioj is released into your system. Anyway, I'm very wary in having to go the generic route but if I stay on Lialda, it will cause me to eventually go broke. My insurance won't cover much of the cost now and Lialda stopped their co-pay program. This is really disheartening to say the least.",humira,2,,,

"OCREVUS (Ocrelizumab) is the new approved drug for the treatment of patients with relapsing or primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Iâ€™ve been on Rituxan, the sister drug to Ocrevus, for over a year. The comparison on the drugs is mostly illustrated in my blog post hereâ€¦  Ocrelizumab versus Rituximab (Rituxan) I made the error thinking same company, basically same drug, easy transitionâ€¦.NOT!!! Last Friday I found out that my infusion place that I was receiving the Rituxan from, WILL NOT be doing Ocrevus infusions. They arenâ€™t going to be trained. My doctorâ€™s requested that I get the infusion done in NYC again, as I did when I started Rituxan. Normally I wouldnâ€™t have a problem, but I donâ€™t drive that far, my step dad takes off from work to take me, itâ€™s a very long day, and just like the infusion for Rituxan, this infusion is done once and then two weeks later it is done again. (I should make a sidebar note here that from this point forward Ocrevus is a once every six month whereas Rituxan always follows the same 2 week apart protocol.) The idea of going to the city for my infusion was the beginning of the mess. I also had to get an appointment made. I called the first time, and after I gave my information and appointment requirements, I was told the computer froze sheâ€™d have to call me right back. Ten minutes later, NO CALL, shocking. I call again. This time they tell me I canâ€™t make an appointment until my doctor puts the orders into the computer for me to receive Ocrevus. I called the doctorâ€™s assistant, got a voicemail. Sent an email. In the reply email Iâ€™m told that the doctor will put the orders in as soon as she receives the blood work back. BLOOD WORK? When was I asked for blood work. Mind you this is all happening between the hours of 4-5 on Friday. Iâ€™m now closing in on the 5 oâ€™clock hour when I get â€œIâ€™ll have the doctor send a prescription for blood tests to you on Tuesdayâ€. I saw my doctor about changing to Ocrevus on June 2, this was always the plan. I am just finding out about blood work now!! Very frustrating. On top of everything else, insurance approval doesnâ€™t start until the orders are in the system and an appointment is made. All I can say is WTF!!!! My next infusion is supposed to be on July 17. Iâ€™m willing to bet it will be Rituxan again. I donâ€™t think we will be ready to transition even with the full 7 weeks we gave.",ocrevus,2,,,
"Well, well, well. I did say I wouldnâ€™t update this blog again until I had neutrophils, and now I have NEUTROPHILS!!! As Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re already well aware if youâ€™re reading this, because I have shouted it emphatically at anyone and everyone within physical and digital hearing range. Not only have I had neutrophils for a month now, but since my beautiful sweet little neuts returned my count has remained above 1 the entire time, and at its highest it was 17 ðŸ˜±. A normal neutrophil count is between 1.5 â€“ 8, so 17 was fiercely celebrated but a bit extreme. What was also extreme was my bone pain at this time, I had been warned that having bone marrow swelling from all of the new cell activity would be painful but sheeeesh. I have said this a thousand times to anyone that will listen, but I am still in shock that my neutrophils came back so rapidly, after so long of NOTHING. Bizarrely in the first few days of my hospital admission, my neut count crept up to 0.07 before plummeting back to 0 for the next 7 weeks. Haematology didnâ€™t want to discharge me until my ANC was 1.5, so by my calculations, once daclizumab was cleared from my system/the treatment kicked in it would take me at least a further 2 months to reach a healthy neutrophil count. And that was only if the damage was reversible/drugs would work.   Mask fashun whilst on day leave Because there was no precedent for what happened to me, the doctors had no idea what to do. The theory was that daclizumab (my MS treatment) had interacted with my CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency) and shut down my neutrophil production, but this was just the most likely scenario and none of the doctors could confirm with certainty that this was actually what had happened. Daclizumab had only been TGA approved for use in RRMS for less than a year so literature was lacking, and from what I understand the incidence of people with both MS and CVID is extremely low (MS is approx 1:1000, CVID is approx 1:30,000). Haematology came in on numerous occasions and just flat out told me â€œwe honestly have no idea what to do with you.â€ Immunology told me that they were trying everything they could and were researching like mad but had no idea if I would ever recover. And at the height of the infection I caught whilst neutropenic when I was looking for reassurance and asked a doctor from the Infectious Diseases department if I was going to die, all he could offer was â€œI really hope not.â€ Most of my 8 weeks in hospital has blurred into one long horrific day, but August 8 stands out as the day I literally got my life back. It started out like any other day, which was basically me trying to make myself look as presentable and healthy as possible so the doctors would approve me for day leave (essentially I just put clothes on and brushed my hair, which I was too sick to do for the first month so this was a big improvement ðŸ˜‚). I was sitting on the bed trying to make myself look nonchalant and full of energy when the resident came in and told me that incredibly my neutrophil count from the day before had come back as 0.07. 0.07 was amazing. I could have cried. Then the consultant came in and told me that the count was actually 0.7. I did cry. The haematologists wanted to check my films with their own eyes before we celebrated, so off they went to the lab, and came back shortly after to confirm that my blood was ABUNDANT with fluffy little white cells. Even the consultant from my haem team who had just rotated off from ward duty came up to tell me he wanted to crack a bottle of champagne. After spending 7 weeks thinking I was more than likely going to die, the rush of elation and relief was indescribable. I went on day leave but missed a call from the hospital shortly after. They left a voicemail telling me that my neutrophil count from my bloods taken that morning was 3.9. I lay in my bed and listened to that voicemail 20 times. In the space of 24 hours, I had gone from being a patient that ticked every single box in the highest risk category to completely normal. We ripped up the sign on my door telling hospital staff and visitors to wear masks around me, we stopped the GCSF injections that were stimulating my bone marrow, I started eating fruit and vegetables that didnâ€™t need to be peeled (bacteria risk) and I threw out all my Dettol (just kidding, Iâ€™m not that reckless). Even my haematologists seemed surprised at my neutrophilsâ€™ dramatic reappearance, but reasoned that they had been flogging my body with every drug imaginable and it had all finally kicked in. For the first time since I was admitted, a planned discharge date went up on the board in my room. It was one week away, and in that time weâ€™d make sure my neutrophils stayed stable off the GCSF, and start tinkering with the dosages of my other meds.   My PICC consistently caused me nothing but grief and was frequently blocked â€“ it would flush but not aspirate meaning my bloods were more often than not taken peripherally (what is the point ðŸ˜‘). In this pic we are sending a drug called alteplase down the line to break up the blood clots. Of course nothing is ever that simple with me, and whilst my white blood cells were behaving beautifully, in the lead up to discharge I was extremely tachycardic and my haemoglobin was dropping. The haematologists had no explanation for my haemoglobin levels except that maybe my bone marrow was still in a bit of a slump. We knew that it was likely the same thing causing my tachycardia and anaemia, and the haematologists were worried that it might be an infection that my immunosuppression meant I wasnâ€™t showing any other symptoms for. We pulled my PICC line out early in case that was the infection source but the tip of the PICC was sent for testing and didnâ€™t grow anything.   Itâ€™s the day Iâ€™ve been waiting for! Getting my frenemy PICC line removed By the time it came to my planned day of discharge however the new thinking was that I either had a blood clot in my lungs or a slow internal bleed ðŸ˜‘. By now my haemoglobin had dropped to 72, so I was given another blood transfusion. Haematology werenâ€™t overly concerned by the possibility of an internal bleed, but they were worried about the possibility of a blood clot. So I was sent down to nuclear medicine because I havenâ€™t had enough radiation exposure ðŸ’   How I felt about having a blood transfusion hours after having my PICC pulled and needing to be cannulated again ðŸ˜  After more x-rays looking for infection in my body, I had 2 SPECT scans. For the first scan I had to breathe in a radioactive gas, and then for the second scan I was injected with a radioactive dye. Both scans were of my lungs, and compared where the radioactive gas was able to travel with where the dye went. If there were discrepancies then that meant I had a clot.   Probably wouldnâ€™t have worn a crop top if Iâ€™d realised I was going to be scanned with my arms above my head for an hourâ€¦ By the time I got back to the ward it was nearly 7pm and I had completely given up on discharge that day. But then one of my doctors came to see me â€“ the scans confirmed I had no blood clot and I was good to go home!!!!   After being in hospital so long it was a strange feeling being discharged and almost anticlimactic. I was relieved, overwhelmed, sad, and scared that something would happen and I would die without constant observation. I hadnâ€™t had a good sleep the entire time I was in hospital, be it from the drug-induced insomnia, ward noises (the haematology ward is the LOUDEST ward I have ever been in and there seems to be a lot of MET calls â€“ as I can attest to) or being woken up in the middle of the night for IV meds or bloods. I slept for a full 7 hours in my bed that night which was THE GREATEST. But when I woke up my heart was racing. Thereâ€™s not too much normal about waking up with a heart rate of 130. I was starting to really freak out about my potential internal bleed. So it was nice to find out that I didnâ€™t have one, and that the symptoms were not my bodyâ€™s fault for once! I went to see my gastroenterologist that day who took one look at my extensive drug chart and said she was going to have a word with haematology. I went back to Monash the day after for my methotrexate and IVIG and had my rather sheepish looking haem team come to let me know that my gastro had pointed out I was still on Dapsone as a prophylactic â€“ a drug theyâ€™d overlooked on my chart. They ran a few tests on my blood and it turned out not only was Dapsone causing haemolysis (destruction of my red blood cells), but it was also causing methomoglobinemia which meant that the little amount of haemoglobin I did have wasnâ€™t able to properly deliver oxygen around my body. Noooooo wonder I felt like shit. So we unceremoniously kicked Dapsone to the curb so it could hang out with Zinbryta (and Gilenya! and Tecfidera!) in the â€˜drugs that are allowed nowhere near Morganâ€™s bloodâ€™ club. Now that both my neutrophils and haemoglobin are stable, I am sloooooowly weaning off prednisolone but will likely stay on methotrexate for a couple of years. MTX seems to be some kind of wonder drug in that it is also good for my MS and mysterious â€œlooks like coeliac but isnâ€™t coeliacâ€ gut issues, so I am happy to stay on it, especially whilst my body is healing and reconditioning.   Not that I have any recollection of this, but Iâ€™ve been told this was my first meal after a month of infection and non-stop vomiting. This was just after I was started on a massive dose of methylprednisolone and was starting to feel a bit more human. The white bag hanging up in the top right corner is called TPN and was feeding me through my PICC line. In terms of nutrition, I am now able to eat again like a normal person and am putting weight on ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ At my lowest in hospital I weighed 42kg, so I had a feeding tube put down my nose a second time with the idea that I would eat normally throughout the day and each night the tube would deliver me an extra 1000 calories that my body so desperately needed. I have barely any memory of the first tube I had during my admission because I was so unwell and barely lucid at that point, but I definitely could not tolerate the second tube. I was in a lot of pain and threw up everything I was fed so the tube lasted an entire 24 hours before it was pulled out.   Can you tell how much I am enjoying the tube The clinical nutrition doctors were pretty unimpressed and threatened to put a PEG tube in (a tube surgically placed into the stomach through the abdomen ðŸ˜±) but haematology wouldnâ€™t let anyone operate on me without neutrophils (hence why I have also had to wait for surgery on my ear for so long). Now that I am no longer neutropenic my gastro floated the option of a PEG tube again last week, but I laughed and shouted NO, so am diligently consuming all the fat shakes, protein supplements and chocolate (life is tough) that I can.   Much happier My health is a full time job at the moment and I have hospital appointments/treatment (methotrexate/IVIG) 3 or 4 days each week, but this will decrease over the next couple of months and Iâ€™ll be able to go back to work ðŸ’°. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute is currently sequencing my exome in the hope that weâ€™ll find the defective gene in my immune system for which I could potentially start treatment to correct.   Just a few other drugs I take dailyâ€¦ Amongst this lot I am on prophylactic antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals to prop up my shitty immune system I used to think of my health as the solar system. MS was the big bad sun and all of my comorbidities were planets in orbit around the MS. But now Iâ€™m starting to think MS is actually just a planet, and CVID is the real sun. MS definitely takes the planetary cake as big olâ€™ Jupiter, but CVID is the bastard who not only has given me an immune system deficient in antibodies, but an immune system that when confronted likes to attack and shut down various functions in my body as it sees fit. To be fair, CVID was more like a star in a distant galaxy for the first 2 decades of my life, so much so that I couldnâ€™t see it and had no idea it existed. It wasnâ€™t until I was 20 and began immunotherapy for my MS that the CVID became enraged. When I was diagnosed with MS I had 1 specialist â€“ a neurologist. 4 years of immunotherapy combined with CVID later and my tally of specialist teams has hit 9 ðŸ˜³. If it ends in â€˜-ologistâ€™, I probably have one. It feels outrageous that there is so much wrong with my body and the amount of medical intervention I require to stay alive, and I felt pretty bloody shit about it when I was in hospital, but I am reasonably adjusted to the fact that this is the hand Iâ€™ve been dealt and Iâ€™m living my best life. I do panic about my future and the fact that Iâ€™ve been through so much and am only 24 â€“ thereâ€™s so many years left of my life (hopefully) for things to go wrong in! What else will happen before I turn 30! But I think my GP put it best this week when we were joking that I excel at getting sick and she said, â€œbut youâ€™re also incredibly good at getting better.â€ This post is pretty long now and I havenâ€™t even touched on whatâ€™s happening with my MS or my melanoma! So I will leave that for another blog post. Thanks for reading until the end and for coming along on the ride with me. Morgan xxx",gilenya,2,,,
"The addition of PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab to standard first-line chemotherapy for treatment-naÃ¯ve advanced non-small-cell lung cancer significantly improves response rates and progression-free survival, researchers reported at the ESMO 2016 Congress in Copenhagen today. Pembrolizumab is a class of immunotherapeutic anti-cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which target the mechanism the tumour uses to shut down the bodyâ€™s immune response. â€œPembrolizumab enables T cells to â€˜reactivateâ€™ and accomplish what they are designed to do â€“ facilitate tumour cell killing,â€ said principal investigator Dr Corey Langer, director of the Thoracic Oncology Program at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, US. In the phase II KEYNOTE-021 study, researchers randomized 123 patients with stage IIIB/IV, chemotherapy-naive, nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer to receive four cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 every three weeks), with or without 24 months treatment with pembrolizumab (200mg every three weeks). After a median follow-up of 10.6 months, researchers observed a significantly greater objective response rate (55% vs. 29%, P = 0.0016) in the patients who received pembrolizumab as well as chemotherapy, compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. While patients were not selected by the amount of PD-L1 expression in their tumour, researchers did note a higher response rate (around 80%) for the pembrolizumab and chemotherapy combination in tumours with PD-L1 expression greater than or equal to 50%. Participants in the pembrolizumab arm also experienced an improved progression-free survival (median 13.0 months vs. 8.9 months) although overall survival rates were similar between the two arms (6 month survival rate = 92%), in this early landmark assessment. There was a higher incidence of adverse events of grade 3 severity or above in the pembrolizumab arm compared to the chemotherapy alone arm (39% vs. 26%), but this had no impact on treatment discontinuation rates (10% for the pembrolizumab arm compared to 13% for the chemotherapy only arm) or treatment-related deaths. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue and nausea, which were more common in patients receiving pembrolizumab, and anemia, which was more common in the chemotherapy alone arm of the study. â€œThis is the first randomized phase II trial in advanced, treatment-naÃ¯ve non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer to assess the benefit of adding a monoclonal antibody targeting PD1 to standard chemotherapy,â€ said Langer. â€œIf these benefits are confirmed in an ongoing phase III trial, the results may radically alter the treatment paradigm in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.â€ Commenting on the study, Dr Raffaele Califano, Consultant in Medical Oncology at The Christie Hospital and University Hospital of South Manchester in Manchester, UK said: â€œData for the combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in this population is certainly encouraging, and it is reassuring to see that the addition of pembrolizumab to first-line chemotherapy has a manageable toxicity profile and doesnâ€™t increase the incidence of treatment-related adverse events or deaths.â€ â€œNotably, the progression-free survival reported in the standard arm was much longer than expected and nearly doubled when compared to historical data, which could be due to patient selection or other clinical/molecular characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study,â€ Califano said. â€œIn order to establish if this strategy should be adopted in clinical practice, these results should be investigated further in a phase III randomized study with a similar design, adequately powered for progression-free survival and with robust assessment of patientâ€™s reported outcomes.â€ Source: ESMO",pemetrexed,2,,,

"Hi all, I'm new to the forum. On December 12th, my mom was diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC. Tumor pathology: non-squamous adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 less than 1%, and negative for all targetable mutations. She has 2 spots on her lung, with 1 tumor on a nearby lymph node, 1 tumor on her left adrenal gland, and at least 10, but potentially 12, brain mets. The brain mets are scattered throughout her brain - several in the frontal lobe, at least one in her left parietal, and at least one right on top of her cerebellum. My father took her to the ER on 12/6 with major neurological symptoms (she insisted she was fine, despite the fact that her right hand wouldn't function), which was the beginning of this entire whirlwind. Mom has handled the news exceedingly well - partly because she's tough and no-nonsense and partly because the tumors in her frontal lobe help her out in this respect (hence, her thinking she was fine even while knowing her right hand wouldn't work). She spent 1 weeks in the hospital on intense steroids to reduce swelling, and then a week in inpatient rehab to help her regain right hand function and improve her balance, etc. While still in rehab, she began whole brain radiation. She came home on 12/22 and just finished treatment on 1/3. She tolerated radiation well and is doing better every day. We are now weighing next steps. Quality of life is my mom's priority. She has amazingly and fortunately experienced no pain so far. She is not interested in clinical trials. (I'm a scientist and a former researcher, so I am very pro clinical trials as a general philosophy but I 100% support my mom in her choice, so I'm not even going there). To quote her, â€œIâ€™m in no pain, Iâ€™m not nauseous, I donâ€™t feel sick, and I intend to keep it that way.â€ Her doc is recommending 4 to 6 cycles of Carboplatin, Pemetrexed (Alimta), and Pembrolizumab (Keytruda).

"PCORI Awards $20M to 4 Studies Comparing Current Drug and Rehab Therapies for MS Magdalena Kegel The National Multiple Sclerosis Society reported that the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has granted nearly $20 million in funding to four research projects assessing various multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies for their clinical effectiveness. Two of the grants will cover studies comparing disease-modifying treatments, looking to identify differences in how effective the drugs are, as well as assessing their downsides. A third funded project will evaluate drugs to alleviate fatigue, and the fourth will assess whether MS patients living in rural or low-income areas benefit equally well from rehabilitation provided through phone or the internet as those with access to clinic-based rehabilitation. All the projects are noteworthy for their patient engagement, a key focus of PCORI-funded research. MS patients, family caregivers and MS healthcare providers, such as nurses and physicians, will contribute to both the design and performance of the studies. â€œThese PCORI awards are a welcome and much-needed infusion of new MS research funding for important real-world questions about treatment strategies and their effectiveness,â€ Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of Research at the National MS Society, said in a news release. â€œPCORI is delighted to make these new awards addressing crucial evidence gaps and questions of vital interest to the more than 400,000 people in the U.S. living with multiple sclerosis,â€ added Joe Selby, MD, MPH and executive director at PCORI. â€œThese studies will provide significant new evidence to help patients, their families, and their clinicians decide more confidently which of the therapies available to them will work best given their needs and preferences.â€ The design and selection of the four studies came from priorities identified at a 2015 workshop. There, people with MS, their healthcare providers, scientists, government agencies, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and health insurers gathered to refine the questions that PCORI later used for their funding announcements. The session identified a number of evidence gaps and other issues put forward as top priorities by workshop participants â€” now addressed by these four research projects. The first grant of $8.5 million went to a study that will explore if the biological drug Rituxan (rituximab) is more effective than other commonly used disease-modifying drugs for people with relapsing-remitting MS, also also compare side effects between drugs. The study will be based at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and performed in partnership with healthcare insurance provider Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Another $5.8 million goes to a project run by a research team from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, assessing whether patients in Alabama and Mississippi rural and low-income areas benefit as much from an exercise-based rehabilitation program delivered via internet or telephone, as when the therapy is provided in a clinic. Clinics providing such services in these areas are scarce, putting emphasis on alternative options. Three drugs often used to relieve fatigue in people with MS will be evaluated in a study at the University of California at San Francisco that received $1.9 million. The drugs â€“ Symmetrel (amantadine), Provigil (modafinil), and methylphenidate (known under several brand names, including Ritalin) â€“ have rarely been compared side-by-side. Finally, $3.3 million was awarded to a trial comparing benefits and side effects of the two oral disease-modifying treatments Gilenya (fingolimod) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate). Again, the drugs have never been directly compared, and although the general view is that they are similarly effective, their side effects might differ. The trial will be led by a research team based at the Foundation of the Carlo Besta Neurological Institute in Italy, and will include study sites in the U.S., Europe, and Israel. The MS grants were among 35 grants totaling $153 million to support research in various disease areas that were approved by PCORIâ€™s Board of Governors last week.",gilenya,2,,,

"Hi Mohit, Welcome to GRACE. I am sorry to hear of the recent progression of your fatherâ€™s lung cancer. Though there are some oncologists who like to continue Tarceva even after progression, combining it with a drug such as Alimta (pemetrexed), most often if the progression is significant enough a third generation EGFR TKI such as Tagrisso will be chosen. In addition, some doctors choose a combination of afatinib and cetuximab, which can be effective but can be quite challenging in terms of the combined side effects. EGFR-positive patients often overlook standard chemotherapy, which tends to be quite effective in this subgroup of patients. Regimens such as carboplatin or cisplatin, in combination with alimta or taxol are often used.

The findings were presented by Zhong et al at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2018 Congress ( Abstract LBA48_PR ). â€œOur results suggest promise for the use of biomarker-guided neoadjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment strategies in stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC,â€ said Yi-Long Wu, MD , Tenured Professor at Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute in Guangzhou, China, and principal investigator of the CTONG 1103 study. â€œThis is the first study to demonstrate progression-free survival superiority for erlotinib over gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting of stage IIIA-N2 EGFR -mutated NSCLC,â€ Dr. Wu added. CTONG 1103 Results A total of 386 patients from 17 centers in China were screened, and 72 were randomly assigned 1:1 to therapy and included in the intention-to-treat population. The objective response rate (ORR) for neoadjuvant erlotinib vs gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy was 54.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 37.2%â€“70.9%) vs 34.3% (95% CI = 17.7%â€“50.8%) with an odds ratio of 2.26 (95% CI = 0.87â€“5.84; P = .092). After neoadjuvant therapy, 83.8% of patients in the erlotinib group and 68.6% in the gemcitabine-plus-cisplatin group underwent surgery. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer with erlotinib at 21.5 months (95% CI = 19.3â€“23.6) vs gemcitabine-plus-cisplatin chemotherapy at 11.9 months (95% CI = 9.1â€“14.7) with a hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% CI = 0.23â€“0.76; P = .003). Overall survival is too immature to report, said Dr Wu. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were fewer in the erlotinib arm (0%) compared to the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm (29.4%). Current treatment strategies for resected stage IIIA-N2 EGFR -mutated NSCLC are controversial, explained Dr Wu, but EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to improve the prognosis of patients with advanced EGFR -mutant NSCLC. â€œCisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment for stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC only gives patients [a] 5% 5-year overall survival benefit,â€ said Dr. Wu, explaining the unmet medical need in this patient population. â€œRecently, the CTONG 1104 trial [published by Zhong et al in Lancet Oncology ] showed for the first time that adjuvant â€¦ gefitinib [Iressa] could improve disease-free survival by 10 months compared to adjuvant chemotherapy (28.7 vs 18.0 months) in N1â€“N2 resected NSCLC. This raises the possibility that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors may play a beneficial role in the neoadjuvant setting for this subgroup.â€ The content in this post has not been reviewed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc.

"Traveling with multiple sclerosis doesnâ€™t have to be an ordeal. But it can be a bit more complex, especially if you have a bit of disability (mobility wise especially) or are on a disease-modifying therapy like the injectabes (Copaxone, Rebif, Avonex, Betaseron, Extavia). All are shot therapies (needles+airplanes=hmm), and all require you to keep an eye on temperature: not too cold, not too hot. Hereâ€™s some practical advice ActiveMSers has culled from fellow MSers, travel agents, airline staff, cruise lines, disability specialists, and personal experienceâ€”I've traveled to 50+ countries on six continents, many of them after being diagnosed, and many using walking aids or a wheelchair. I seriously get around. You can, too. Here's how.   Even Machu Picchu can be made accessible. General Tips A letter from your doctor stating you have multiple sclerosis is a good idea. I read about a woman denied an extra drink on a flight because she looked drunk. She claimed she had MS. Now a doctorâ€™s letter might not have helped in that particular situation because you can still be drunk and have MS, but I digress. Keep with you your MS specialistâ€™s phone number, e-mail, and off-hours pager number. If you are traveling out of the country, donâ€™t forget to add on the country code when you dial. Remember that there is a difference between an exacerbation and a pseudoexacerbation. According to the NMSS website, a true exacerbation â€œis a worsening of old symptoms or the appearance of new ones that last at least 24 hours. This is important because stress, heat, and/or fatigue (all of which easily happen while traveling) could cause a temporary symptom flare, which should clear by the next day.â€ Pace yourself. You know your body better than anyone. If you know going all-out is going to put the hurt on your body, save that climb of Kilimanjaro for the end of your holiday and recover on that plane ride. And remember, you don't have to do everything in the guidebooks for your holiday to be called a success. Choose activities wisely and build in recovery time. Check the ego. You have lots of tools at your disposal to make traveling easierâ€”use them. Wheelchairs, canes, trekking poles, scooters, rollaters, disposable undergarments, you name it. Is someone staring? Who bloody cares. It's probably wise that you donâ€™t take your medication out of their original labeled containers when it comes to cryptic pills (disease-modifying injectable MS meds are okay since they are labeled). The dudes, especially in customs, donâ€™t really like to guess what pills are what. Taking Tysabri, Lemtrada or Rituxan? Be sure to plan around your infusion dates. Katmandu likely does not have an infusion center you can use. Don't underestimate the importance of a reliable travel companion. When you need a little extra assistance, an extra pair of able-bodied hands (and legs) can be a godsend. Mentally note all bathrooms and, when traveling internationally, avoid passing up a good one. There are cell phone apps that help you find public potties, but watch data fees overseas. And if you do, remember where it is so you can hustle back to it when nature calls. She always tends to ring at the most inopportune times! If you are traveling to remote areas, in particular if you are venturing outside the US into non-industrialized countries, you may want to ask your neurologist for a prescription of oral steroids (Prednisone). That way, if you have an exacerbation on a long trekking trip, say in Nepal, a dose of oral steroids could trim your attack symptoms big time and save your vacation. NOTE: Only do this if you have previously taken oral steroids and are aware of how the drug affects you. Don't wait. Don't save that dream trip until you retire. Or until the kids are grown. Or until you feel better. MS is unpredictable; go now. Carpe diem . Seize the day, savor moments, and make your vacation unforgettable for all the right reasons. Focus on the instances that make travel enjoyable, not on your disease.   Running with bulls in Spain.  An overly accessible bathroom/jungle gym.  Seize the day! (And when windy, the railing.) Planning Your Trip Consider using a travel agent who specializes in making arrangements for those with disabilities. This is especially useful if you require a wheelchair. Be sure to inform your agent about your special needs: your current mobility, equipment you will be bringing (or need at your destination), seating preferences, etc. Here is a detailed list of travel agents around the US and around the US who are experienced in working with handicapped folks: http://www.disabledtravelers.com/travel_agents.htm. For Europe, Sage Traveling has gobs of trips in dozens of cities that are wheelchair accessible: http://www.sagetraveling.com/ View your accommodations online before you make reservations. Note stairs, pool access, restrooms, exercise room, etc. Have questions? E-mail or call. You don't want to be stuck going up stairs at a B&B when you thought it was a single level. Also, don't trust ""handicap accessible"" declarations. What some folks think is accessible is downright laughable. The best solution if you have severe mobility issues: ask for pics and even video. Even then you can't trust areas to be accessible. In Peru, I cannot count the number of bathrooms that were ""wheelchair accessible"" that, despite appearancesâ€”oversized with grab bars galoreâ€”required getting out of the chair before you were anywhere near the toilet. Stall doors often would not close if you brought in the wheelchair. On another occasion, the bathroom door when open blocked the toilet. A room with an accessible bathroom isn't just for folks who use wheelchairs. As one ActiveMSer discovered, having a larger bathroom with grab bars is especially helpful after an exhausting day. Some hotels will have shower chairs available if the shower is not already equipped with one, but again you better ask. Sinks may or may not allow you to roll under them, so if you are wheeling it, ask. And doorways and/or bathrooms (heck, even bedrooms) may not be wide enough for your chair, especially if you are traveling overseas, so have a tape measurement of your minimum requirements needed. The time of year you travel absolutely makes a difference. I prefer to travel in the off season (less standing in line, easier to get into restaurants, better seats at special events) and when temperatures are cooler. If heat wears you out, traveling when it's toasty could turn a vacation into little more than a quest for A/C. Consider a cruise, even if you are not a ""cruiser."" I've traveled by ship extensively pre and post MS, indeed one trip was nearly four months that took me around the world, and it has a host of advantages. You unpack once (great for fatigue), disability access is good (especially if you need mobility aids), a doctor is always onboard (helpful if you have a relapse), and your travel time is often at night when you are sleeping (no exhausting car rides). Recommendations? I like Alaska during the summer, the Caribbean during the winter, and Europe for the fall and spring. Note: there are travel agencies that specialize in adaptive cruise shore excursions. Want a more far-flung adventure? An African safari is great because you travel by 4x4, which means access to A/C and that you are seated. The lodges can be spectacular (in Kenya I actually slept in a bed that was 11x9, the size of a bedroom!) and the staff will cater to your special needs. Can you say multiple sclerosis in 35 languages? If you are traveling to a country where you don't speak the language, then download onto your phone the free A ccessible Travel Phrase Book PDF by Lonely Planet. Asking for an accessible bathroom, an elevator, and countless other essentials when you have a disability just got way easier. Purchase travel insurance when you book your trip (we like AIG Travel Guard). Most travel insurance companies WILL recognize pre-existing conditions like MS, but only if you purchase the insurance within 10-15 days of putting down a deposit on the trip. If you miss that window, any MS event will void out your travel insurance and you are on your own. Now if you meant to buy travel insurance and spaced it (I can be such a dolt!), there are plans from Travel Insured International (www.travelinsured.com) that you can purchase up 30 days after your initial deposit. Remember, ""initial deposit"" includes any funds to the trip down to the penny. And a word of warning: if you buy your insurance from the same company you are traveling with and they go belly up, you are SOL. So I always recommend buying your insurance from a third party and NOT through your travel agent/company or cruise ship.   Wheeling through Athens, Greece.  Cruising is an easy, accessible option for MSers.  Riding camels in the Sahara Desert. Why the hell not? Gear Unless you need them to help you walk around in the airport, pack your trekking poles in your luggage to avoid juggling two poles. Canes are allowed aboard airplanes, trekking poles are as well (tell anyone who asks that they are mobility aids), ski poles are almost always frowned upon. Forearm crutches are no problem, but a flight attendant may have to store them in another area on the plane if they don't fit in your overhead bin. If that happens, just seat surf to the bathrooms. Better yet, you could be lucky enough to own a set of jointed forearm crutches, like this trick pair developed by Dick Fate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMEJao8GOw. They fold up in a jiff and can be stored under the seat in front of you. The easiest cooling vest to pack is one that is evaporative, since it is lightweight uncharged. But they perform poorly in humid conditions. Since usable freezers can be hard to find, my preferred all-around travel vests are those that recharge in ice (Glacier Tek's vest, www.glaciertek.com) or at room temperature (First Line Technology's vest, www.firstlinetech.com). ""One thing you have to watch is that the TSA loves to search bags that are carrying cooling vests/hats/scarves that have hydration beads. Avoid someone pawing through your luggage. Take them in your carry on and inform the screener."" - Mary, Washington If you are going to carry on your cooling vest into the plane, a doctor's note is extremely helpful or it could be confiscated due to the gel or other filling. Evaporative vests are okay if they are not charged. On a recent trip, TSA let my gel vest through without a question, although I announced I had one before sending it through Xray. A United Airlines security rep wants me to remind all of you with cooling vests NOT to actually wear it when going through security. You know what those gel packs look like when they scan your body? Like a bomb strapped to your chest! Take it off or tell your friends to break out their cameras to film the chaos. I like a tiny, lightweight digital camera or cell phone to record my travel memories: photographs, audio and video. The weight savings and convenience of just slipping it in your pocket is invaluable. I don't like the cane/seat combo (oh, but it sounds so convenient): it's a crummy cane and a crummy seat. Get your pants a little dirty and sit on a curb if you must. Get a wheelie bag if you donâ€™t already have one. No sense in burning up energy lugging around your granddadâ€™s old military-issue trunk because it looks cool and has a lot of stickers. The absolute smartest packing advice taken from veteran travelers: make whatever you bring fit into a single carry-on bag, especially if you are going to be traveling to multiple destinations. Yes, this includes if you are going overseas for three weeks. You'll never lose a bag, it's far easier to handle than larger luggage, substantially lighter, and you can pawn it off on a travel companion if need be! Bring multiple forms of walking aids. Why? If you lose your cane, you still have your trekking poles and vice versa. Also, if you primarily use a rollator/walker, bring a cane or forearm crutches! I heard from one MSer who had so much trouble with cobblestone streets in Italy that her rollator was essentially useless. The cane, although it meant slower going, saved her vacation. A pair of forearm crutches offers three times the support of a single cane and can make getting around on uneven surfaces a cake walk. If you need help getting around the airport or a massive hotel or a museum, ask. Donâ€™t be shy. This is your vacation and you donâ€™t want to spend two days recovering from what amounts to stubborn pride. Most facilities have wheelchairs you can borrow, although be forewarned: you'll often get a beater. On a recent trip to Boston, I got overconfident and failed to bring my wheelchair. And none were available to rent. So we switched hotels to one that provided a chair to guests and used it all weekend. It saved our trip from being a series of short cab rides. A personal favorite travel companion in the summertime is a travel umbrella, in particular the sun-safe umbrellas from Gustbuster (order at www.innovagolf.com ). They handle winds at up to 55 mph and provide instant shade and relief from the heat (great for spectator sports or long lines outdoors). Plus, it comes in kinda handy if it rains. If you need a wheelchair when traveling by plane or ship (and you are not a full-time scooter user), most MSers suggest taking a manual chair if at all possible. You donâ€™t have to worry about recharging batteries and dealing with the hassles of stowing the chair. Manual chairs can be brought up to the gate without a problem and are easier to tote in cars. If you own one that is lightweight and has removable wheels, even better. You can rent wheelchairs easily in some countries. For instance, in France virtually all corner pharmacies have a chair to rent (the quality is iffy, though), usually for less than 10 Euros a day. This made train travel much easier as I didn't have to lug a wheelchair on and off public transport, as I would just get a chair in our destination town. But you can't always count on this. In Italy, wheelchairs were impossible to find. So you don't have to lug your scooter around or worry about getting it broken, rent one at your destination. Companies will usually deliver your ride directly to your hotel and then pick it up when you are finished, dramatically lowering the hassle factor (how many cabs are equipped to tote a scooter). Thanks for the great tip, Ruth!   With carry-on bags stacked on my lap, I double as a luggage cart.  Trekking through Bhutan with my trusty poles.  Cold water and cooling vest are always recommended. On the Plane / In the Airport If you are traveling with a personal wheelchair, be sure to gate-check your wheels, so that you can take it all the way up to actually boarding the plane. When you leave your chair at the plane's entry, detach all easily removeable items and take them aboard the plane personally as a carry-on item. That includes seat cushions, footplates, and armrests. I like to bring a small stuff sack to, well, stuff everything into so that my wheelchair knicknacks stay in one place, limiting the risk of something falling out of the bin and clunking an innocent stranger on the head. And by taking gear with you, it will minimize the risk of losing an important piece of equipment. It will seriously suck if they lose a left footplate and you've got to enjoy your entire vacation with your legs crossed ... even when you don't have to tinkle. Is TSA Precheck worth it ($85 for 5 years, Global Entry is $100)? If you fly more than once or twice a year, probably. You get to speed through the security check, waits are usually less than 5 minutes, and you get to keep your shoes on, belt on, and your liquids can stay in your bag. If you use a wheelchair, there is usually no pat-down (for a disappointing few weeks last year, it was the full monty) and they just test your hands and chair for explosive residue. Super quick and easy. ""Request wheelchair assistance when booking your flight if you are not bringing your own. When you check in, tell the ticket agent that you had requested assistance and they will call someone for you. This person will take you and whoever is traveling with you thru security--without having to stand in the long lines and right to the gate. If you have to switch planes because you're not flying direct, they will have someone waiting for you to take you to the next gate. If there isn't anyone there, let the gate agent know and they will call for someone for you. When you arrive at your destination, someone will be there and take you to baggage claim. Remember to take some dollar bills to tip with. The wheelchair assistance will help you conserve your energy."" -- Mary, Oklahoma If you are traveling with a scooter or electric wheelchair, it's best if you have a ""gel cell"" or ""dry cell"" battery. If you have a wet cell battery (a rarity these days), the airline will have to remove it from your chair for special storage, a hassle. Again, don't forget to remove seat cushions, etc., to pervent them from getting lost in the belly of the plane as your scooter will either be gate checked or go through checked luggage. Don't forget to secure the key (or power pin) with something a bit stronger than a rubberband. Some suggest fishing line. And setting the throttle on the slowest setting and taping over it will help prevent speedy joyrides. How much does your scooter or wheelchair weigh? If it is too heavy, it may not be allowed on some flights. We recommend calling ahead to check for any restrictions. On your power chair, if you can remove the joystick, that is recommended. Or at least point it downward. Those little buggers, sticking up at attention, have an uncanny ability to attract errant luggage. ""Look carefully at the airports in which you will change airplanes to know how far you will have to go between gates. For example, in Perth and Brisbane , Australia , the domestic and international terminals are actually separate airports. Not an easy transfer for the mobility impaired. And, always allow longer time than suggested to make any transfer. A notable exception is my home town of Melbourne, where international and domestic flights are in one building."" - Mary, Washington Take advantage of early boarding and ask a flight attendant for help if you need it. Consider using curb-side check in and the luggage porters when you arrive at the airport. Saving your energy for a few bucks is usually worth it. Request an isle or forward seat on the airplane. The closer you are to the front of the airplane, the less walking you have to do. Another reason: h ey , sometimes when us MSers have to go to the lavatory, well, we really gotta go. If the front of the plane is not available, head to the rear. On international flights, I always check www.seatguru.com to find seats close to the toilet, since there are a number of them located in various areas of large planes. Also note that in the last row the seats may not recline fully, but if you have walking aids, you often can store them behind the seat, which makes retrieving them cake. Speaking of bathrooms, it wouldn't hurt to have a change of clothes in your carry on. In fact, I'd consider this mandatory. Sometimes our bodies don't do what they are supposed to do, and wearing clean clothes is a lot better than wearing wet clothes washed in the airplane lavatory. And I'd suggest hitting the restrooms just before boarding. Now, of course, don't dehydrate because of the above advice. Drink plenty of H20. Jetlag may be mitigated with a sleep aid and it can make even an 18-hour plane trip a relative breeze. BUT a few important words of caution. 1) Never drink alcohol and take a sleep aid. 2) Don't try it for the first time on an airplane. 3) Only take it if you have a companion. A United Airlines security rep warned me that altitude, alcohol and Ambien can be a dangerous mix. If you are on lots of meds, keep them on your person. A friend had her baggage confiscated twice--coming and going--because her drugs were packed with her checked luggage. Of course it didn't help matters that we had a transfer in Singapore, noted for hanging folks with too much Tylenol (actually kilos of heroin, but you get the picture). Her bags were delayed for a couple of days, but fortunately her stash of pills was preventative in nature and not critical. Picked up a cool sword-cane in Kenya? If you can't fit it into your checked luggage, I can pretty much guarantee you it will be confiscated, doc note or not. And then all you'll have is a cool sword-cane story of woe.   Flight attendants are quick to help those with a disability.  A travel scooter can be a boon for tired legs.  TSA frowns on sword canes, crossbows, and Wookiees. At Your Destination If you are using a wheelchair, especially internationally, museums and sights are often free and you go straight to the front of the line, no questions asked. Eiffel Tower with a 2-hour wait? Bam, next elevator. Hordes of people surrounding the Mona Lisa? Bam, front-row access, even closer than any able-bodied person. Sistine Chapel access? Bam, through back corridors and hidden passages of the Vatican. When you get to a cafe or hotel that you will be hanging out at for a bit, ask where the toilets are located before you need them. Some are so well hidden, you would never find them. Ever. At one hotel after dinner I was befuddled as to where the bathrooms were. It was around a screen, in a closet, behind a closed door. Also, some are downstairs, requiring a new plan if stairs are off limits. In one case, a waiter took me to a different building altogether to get me to any easy-access toilet. If you don't see an accessible bathroom, ask. One cafe had it hidden behind brooms and boxes. Don't rush. You don't have to cram everything in. Be selective and enjoy what you do. When you get home you'll have far better memories than racing the clock to hit all of the Smithsonian Museums in one D.C. afternoon. Take advantage of breaks. Seek shade, drink some icy beverages, and sit down when you can. The energy you save will come in handy later, trust me. Sometimes convenience costs a little extra. It's often money well spent. If you are rolling, you may need to scout ahead and alter your route to find curb cuts, since some will be blocked or nonexistent. Okay, so you found some incredible (and easily breakable) souvenir on the last days of your trip that will not fit into your luggage with all your clothes ... because you listened to me imploring you not to take a large suitcase. And if you ship it home, odds are high it will break. What to do? Ship home your clothes and toss your new treasure into your bag. Folks are accommodating ... if you ask. A table by the wall (perfect for stashing my forearm crutches), a spot near the bathroom (for those uncertain times), a seat upfront (to avoid the maze of diners) .   Front of the line for us.  Avoid travesty. Don't let your disability stop you from traveling. MS Medication and Travel Advice A small, soft-sided cooler (with an ice park or two, but watch that you don't accidentally freeze your meds) works great to tote your medication and can be stored in a carry-on backpack (so it wonâ€™t count as an extra carry-on). Copaxone, Avonex, Betaseron and Extavia should never be stored at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit; Rebif should never see the light of day above 77 degrees Fahrenheit. Taking a cooler is always a good idea when traveling with your injectables. Even if you are on Betaseron or Extavia, which donâ€™t require refrigeration, you never know when your medication will be sitting in a hot car while you are out on a hike. On an oral drug--Gilenya, Aubagio, or Tecfidera? Avoid extreme temps. In other words, don't leave them roasting in the glovebox of a hot car or exposed when you are camping overnight in Siberia in January. And if you are camping in Siberia in January, I recommend you see a therapist. Always keep your medications with you as part of your carryon luggage. Thatâ€™s one piece of luggage you canâ€™t afford to lose. Itâ€™s smart to have a prescription for your drugs as well as a letter from your doctor stating that you have multiple sclerosis. I personally have never been stopped at security for having a boatload of potentially subcutaneous weapons, but Iâ€™ve been pulled aside for an eyeglass screwdriver that was immediately confiscated with appropriate scolding. The Xray machines used at airports should not harm your medications. If need be, call ahead to your hotel and ask that a portable refrigerator be put in your room if it does not have a mini bar. Most hotels will be able to honor that request. When removing items from your minibar to make room for meds, be sure to later check your bill. Some minibars have the ability to automatically charge your bill for items removed from the fridge, even if you put them back. Bring a couple of digital thermometers that record the ambient air temperature. Put one in the hotel fridge and keep one in the cooler you are transporting your drugs in. Do NOT store your medication in the fridge unless you are certain they wonâ€™t freeze, 36 degrees or above. If you donâ€™t have a thermometer, a bottle with just a touch of water (a tablespoon) will do nicely. Put it in the coldest part of the fridge BEFORE you add your meds. Wait at least a few hours. If it freezes, even on the warmest setting, find a new fridge. Instead of lugging around a big sharps container for your needles, you might consider a needle clipper / storage device. These little gadgets clip off the needle (they can store up to 1,500 needles), allowing you to store the syringe safely. Look for one at your local pharmacy (BD Safe-Clip is one brand). A word of caution, medical waste usually can't be tossed in the trash, so you'll need to find a place to store the empties. At least you won't get poked. Bring a few extra doses just in case you do something stupid and pooch one of your injections or drop a bill down a gutter.

"Hi, Simplest explanation I think because all the relapses are some months after initiation of B cell depletion treatment: Autoantigens are in B cells (including EBV?) and are presented by B cells to T cells inducing relapses. When B cells die by ocrelizumab, B cells are phagocytosed by macrophages or B cell proteins enter the serum-> these B cell proteins are taken up by macrophages which now (instead of B cells) present them to T cells to enhance autoreactive T cells and relapses within a few months after initiation of treatment. Question is: are there any data about what happens immunologically in the immune system during the first weeks when B cells die?",ocrelizumab,2,,,
"Hi @honeyb Lemtrada is a first line DMT in the UK. Many newly DXd patients on Shift with no particularly aggressive disease are offered it there. If you want to halt progression, it is the ticket. I discovered through the earliest use of gabapentin that it solved bladder, pelvic pain that when I switched to pregabalin were not addressed. Needed pregabalin for other pain, added gaba back and it solved the puzzle. I have since read that gaba directly targets the lower part of spine that manages the bladder! Cannabis is not available here. I will press to see how to get it. I have seen several mention it helps. Richard Prior was sad and right! That is the correct word! Spasticity is at the root of much of my pain. You are lucky that is not the case. Are you sure it is not presenting itself like you expected? Thanks for any tips!! I took Gilenya for four years waiting for Lemtrada. It caused me many painful SEs. Lemtrada should be your goal I believe. I was a strong advocate for it here in the States.

"Hi jc587, Welcome to GRACE. Iâ€™m sorry to hear of your momâ€™s diagnosis. Iâ€™m glad that sheâ€™s doing well after addressing the effusion issues, as they can have such an impact on daily life. Itâ€™s true that Tarceva can cross the blood brain barrier and have some effect on brain metastases; most systemic therapy does cross the barrier to one extent or another. The problem is that the concentration of the drug which reaches those brain mets is often not sufficient to be effective. In fact, it is common for EGFR-positive lung canceer to first show progression in the brain, which becomes a â€œsanctuary siteâ€ for the cancer cells. As a result, the standard treatment for multiple brain mets is whole brain radiation.  It is true that WBRT can have side effects, some of which are more likely to appear over time. The problem with the â€œÃ¢â‚¬Å“immediate benefit vs delayed deterioration of quality of lifeâ€ debate is that in many discussions the issue of significant neurological symptoms (and consequent reduction in quality of life) caused by progressing brain mets is not given sufficient consideration.  If the decision is made to forego or delay WBRT, it would be good to closely monitor symptoms and have fairly short interval follow-up scan. I hope Tarceva is effective for your mom for a very long time.

"Iâ€™ve thought a lot about my treatment costs in the past few years and even have raised the question at OhioHealth, where I am treated with Tysabri, made by Biogen. When I first went to this new location in January 2015 the cost was around $14,000 per month. This new medical provider (I followed my neurologist there when he decided to go to a different medical practice) constructed a new building and the infusion clinic was moved there. Initially I was shocked, but then angered to see the cost of my treatment, which was costly enough at $14K per month in their old building had jumped to $22,585 per infusion in the new one, meaning my treatment cost would be billed at over $250,000 for the year. When I checked my medical records for this story, I find my medical provider is now charging $24,908 per treatment, which is more than a 10% increase from January 2015 to April 2016. Part of this is an increase in the drugâ€™s cost and the remainder is their infusion clinic overhead. When I question this, the explanation given is fairly predictable and had to do with negotiated payments and how my insurance was not going to pay that much and it would be a significantly reduced amount that was eventually paid. For the increased bill of $24,908 the clinic provider is â€˜onlyâ€™ paid $12,578. $160,000 per year is the real cost for my treatments based on todayâ€™s pricing, which is still a staggering amount to consider. I continue to have my own mental struggle as to whether this amount of money is worth it in the big picture, considering my age and other factors. Is it fair for my treatment costs to affect the health care dollar costs like this and take a sizeable chunk out of the available monies? How much does my treatment affect the escalating costs of health insurance? MS is a chronic disease that as of now has no known cure and I could conceivably continue on this treatment for the remainder of my life, amassing treatment costs in the millions of dollars. Fortunately for me the entire cost of treatment is covered by my private health care insurance along with the patient assistance program for Tysabri costs. I have paid nothing out of pocket all these years but I imagine these types of bills are part of what is driving up the cost of health insurance, for which I do pay a lot and so does everyone else. Just when I think I am over being angry or frustrated by my MS treatment cost there is often another reminder of this escalating bill, usually in the form of a notice from my insurance telling me how much they had been billed and actually paid. Todayâ€™s reminder came in a different way â€“ through the writings of Dr. Gavin Giavanonni, and Bartâ€™s MS Blog , written by MS doctors and researchers with the departments of Neuroimmunology, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, in the United Kingdom. In this particular article they talk about NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK. One of the functions of NICE is to set pricing for healthcare treatment, including drug costs. NICE decides on what they consider a fair price to pay for a drug and then looks at other options for treating the patient and then decides which would be most cost effective for their government health care system. The blog authors are also concerned about affordability and accessibility of drugs and how the policies of NICE affect treatment and posted this observation from a recent conference â€œAnother ground-shifting poster was the ORATORIO study results (ocrelizumab in PPMS). This study is the first study to show a DMT slowing the rate of disability progression in PPMS. This has to be one of the most significant things to happen in the field of MS in the last 10 years. Despite this I am concerned that NICE may not view ocrelizumab as a treatment for PPMS very favourably. NICE always assesses cost-effectiveness using an incremental cost model. For PPMS the cost-effectiveness of ocrelizumab will be compared to what is out there already, i.e. best supportive care.â€ Their writing had me thinking again about my own treatment cost and now I also wonder if I could put a price on what it might cost to provide me with supportive care compared to the money being spent on my drugs. For now I would not need much in the way of help and all of the money could be spent on someone else. But that picture could change very quickly if my MS progresses because I was not on treatment and I found myself dependent on health care services for my activities of daily living. Would that amount of money take care of me if I were in a nursing facility? In 2013 the average daily cost of nursing home care was $248/day or about $90,000. Just think of the money that would be saved if somewhere someone decided the cost effectiveness of my Tysabri showed that health care money would be better spent by putting me in a nursing home? Reading this question in the Bartâ€™s MS Blog makes me concerned for all of us because the cost effectiveness model might be whatâ€™s needed to control our drug costs here in the US. In some ways our insurance companies are already doing a form of this by often denying treatment or authorizing only certain drugs for reimbursement but not all of them. The topic of cost effectiveness is one of the core points listed in the North American Registry for Care and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (NARCRMS) project, a major initiative for the US and parts of Canada looking to link patient clinical data together. â€œHealth Care Economics Core Will identify information to be collected in the database regarding disability, utilization of health care resources, and employment to help better understand whether the use of expensive therapies has been worthwhile from an economic standpoint, what are the savings from fewer hospitalizations, less disability and longer employment spans, and decreased utility of other health care resourcesâ€ Unlike the system in the UK which helps with the other costs of living such as housing, transportation and medical care for people who are in need due to the financial demands of living with a chronic illness, we donâ€™t have that broad ranging assistance here in the US. My health insurance would not pay any of these living costs â€“ but they will pay for my drugs. Being financially responsible leaves me little choice â€“ I will continue on these treatments despite the escalating costs and my lingering questions and do my best to avoid future care needs that I would have to pay from our own resources. In the meantime I just hope the next bill I open doesnâ€™t cause me to require treatment from choking on the price. be well, Laura",ocrelizumab,0,,,

"@stumbler , thanks for your response. The full story was that these lesions were originally from an earlier MRI. This along with other new (enhanced) lesions in Brain was why I got started on Gilenya. After Gilenya, I did not have either new or enhanced ones in Brain and Spinal Cord. Nor did I get any relapses after. But now, these cord lesions (not all but ones mentioned) are showing hypo-intensity on T1 images which are quite concerning. Does this also warrant changing DMT despite it being not a new enhancing lesion ? Iâ€™m not sure about that one â€¦",gilenya,0,,,

"An article by the same authors on the same topic appears inJAMA Neurology, May 2, 2016, and is available in its entirety online. This is the abstract:  Quote Rebound Syndrome in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis After Cessation of Fingolimod Treatment Stacy Ellen Hatcher, BS1; Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, PhD1; Bardia Nourbakhsh, MD1; Elizabeth Crabtree-Hartman, MD1; Jennifer S. Graves, MD, PhD, MAS1 Author Affiliations 1Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco Importance The appropriate sequencing of agents with strong immune system effects has become increasingly important. Transitions require careful balance between safety and protection against relapse. The cases presented herein highlight that rebound events after ceasing fingolimod treatment may happen even with short washout periods (4 weeks) and may perpetuate despite steroid treatment or the immediate use of fast-acting immune therapies, such as rituximab. Objective To describe rebound syndrome in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) after cessation of fingolimod treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants Clinical and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records from the University of California, San Francisco, Multiple Sclerosis Center from January 2014 to December 2015. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed by MS neurologists (J.S.G., E.W., B.N., and E.C.H.). Rebound syndrome was defined as new severe neurological symptoms after ceasing fingolimod treatment, with the development of multiple new or enhancing lesions exceeding baseline activity. We reviewed the PubMed database from January 2010 to December 2015 for similar cases of severe disease reactivation after ceasing fingolimod treatment using search terms fingolimod and either rebound or reactivation. Participants were included if they stopped receiving fingolimod between January 2014 and December 2015. Five patients were identified who experienced rebound after ceasing fingolimod treatment. Exposures Each patient received treatment with oral fingolimod for various durations. Main Outcomes and Measures Occurrence of rebound after ceasing fingolimod treatment. Results The mean (SD) age of the 5 female patients presented in this case series was 35.2 (6.4) years. Of the 46 patients who stopped fingolimod treatment within the 2-year period, 5 (10.9%) experienced severe relapse 4 to 16 weeks after ceasing fingolimod treatment. Despite varying prior severity of relapsing-remitting course, all participants experienced unexpectedly severe clinical relapses accompanied by drastic increases in new or enhancing lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging evidenced by a median (range) increase of 9 (0->30) new gadolinium-enhancing lesions and a median (range) of 9 (0->30) new T2 lesions. New lesion development persisted for 3 to 6 months despite treatment with corticosteroids (n = 3) and initiation of B-cell depleting therapy (n = 2). In addition, 11 patients were identified through literature review reported as having severe relapses consistent with a rebound syndrome and similar features to our 5 cases. Conclusions and Relevance These cases provide evidence for a fingolimod rebound syndrome at a clinically relevant frequency, highlighting the need to determine the best methods for sequencing or discontinuing MS therapies. A large prospective registry or population-based study would be helpful to confirm this rebound phenomenon and to determine contributing factors, including immune biomarkers, that increase risk for this syndrome.

"Reviving an old thread here. Diagnosed with moderate to severe pan colitis in 2008. Been on everything. Remicade was amazing until new job insurance made it cost like $12,000 per infusion. Been on Humira since and it only seem to be holding me at about 50% remission. For some reason about 2 years ago my GI changed his stance on not prescribing pain meds for IBD. Maybe realized it's true the only thing that can help some people live somewhat normally. I've been on norco 7.5/500, about twice a day for like a year, although I've been on and off opioids for a few years. For me, when I'm not 100% in remission the opioids are the only thing that allows me to operate like a normal human. Cramps, urgency, diarrhea, bleeding, and fatigue are all gone while taking them. Although, I have to agree about the risk of addiction. Even taken as directed you will have withdrawal when stopping. The part that really sucks is that withdrawal symptoms are very similar to UC symptoms. I've been feeling better and tapered off the pain meds. Still feel okay, but the bleeding has returned which is not a withdrawal symptom. I'm going to give it another week and see what happens, but like many have mentioned, the risk of being addicted to opioids is well worth the alternative in many cases.

"I'm mesalamine intolerant and it took my doctors a year and a half of forcing me to try and fail on every mesalamine drug out there before we moved on to Imuran. The thing that finally convinced me: I was having scopes that showed only mild proctitis and was running to the bathroom 30+ times and day and throwing up at night. My doctors kept insisting it might be IBS complicating my UC, but I don't know anyone with IBS who goes to the bathroom 30 times a day every day no matter what they eat. So if your scopes are improving but your symptoms aren't mesalamine may be to blame. Also, consider something like Imuran or 6 MP as your next stop.

"Hey Everyone, My check-up was good. He explained that my goal is to be exactly where I am right now once a year has passed. He said my right leg is about the same since the last time he examined it, which he said was good. So now we are hoping next year it will still be no worse for wear. He told me that the mature B-cells are destroyed by the Ocrevus which stops the progression of MS in my brain. He said they don't really know why it occurs just that it does occur. I will be getting another brain MRI right before I see him in April to see if there is any improvement/difference and then I will be receiving a full dose from there on out. He said it should take as long since it turns out they will be administering it at a faster pace. We sure were glad to hear that. Unrelated to the Ocrevous he asked me again if I had any falls. Last time he asked the answer was no, shortly after that I did have a very strange fall in my bedroom. I had just knelt over and stood up and it was like someone just pushed me over. Before I knew it I had fallen backwards with no time to catch myself. He said it is common and involves the equilibrium and my inner ear and the whole balance and orienting myself. He wanted me to be careful and make sure I always have something to grab hold of for a few seconds so that my brain catches up with my positioning and doesn't just allow me to fall backwards. Strange disease this MS. You think you've been through it all and suddenly something new occurs. I told him a month later I experienced that same weird sensation while in the bathroom but that I recognized it and grabbed hold of my sink and pulled my body forward. It took only a couple of seconds before my brain and body got in sync again so I avoided another fall. He told me it would keep happening without warning so just be prepared for the unexpected. After we finished with the Increvous he then tackled the issues I had been having with my pcp. He agreed to provide scripts for my Lyrica, and Xanax from now on. He even gave me a script for my diabetes med. since my doctor was holding them all hostage to force me to come in for an appointment. He agreed with us that it was time to find another family doctor. I will see her in December. Well if anyone has any questions fire away and hopefully I can answer them for you.

"Hello, I, too, have MS. A few months ago, after not meeting the criteria for the Ocrevus trial ( walking 100 meters independently with no cane), I started doing some research. I had been on Copaxone (stopped due to allergic reaction), And Tecfidera (started it walking independently, within 6 months, I was using a cane). I found the Coimbra Protocol using high doses of vitamin d3. It is not a cure, it is a lifelong treatment program done under a Protocol trained doctor's supervision. I started it on October 6, 2016. Had a small relapse in February 2017, my left leg started ragging, like my right has for years. Scared me. With my doctor's approval I upped my vitamin d3 dosage by 50,000 iu. In THREE days, my leg was back to normal. That has NEVER happened, even with steroids. I have been stable since October. No new symptoms have shown up and stayed. My existing symptoms have not worsened. I decided to ale charge of my own health and try it because at the rate I was going I was afraid I would be in a wheel chair by December 2016. This is a treatment program. It is NOT a cure. Here is a link to a FB group that was very informative and helpful to me. They did not pressure me, simply pointed me in the right direction so that I could gather information and ask questions to help me make an informed decision. https://www.facebook.com/groups/vitamindprotocolnorthamerica/?ref=group_header If it doesn't link correctly, it's call the Coimbra Protocol for Ms and autoimmune diseases , North America.

"MS is more prevalent in women of childbearing age than in any other group. When young women receive a diagnosis of MS, they frequently have questions about the effects of the disease on childbearingâ€”and vice versa. Studies undertaken over the past several decades allow health professionals to provide answers to some of these questions. Download the Pregnancy, Delivery and Post Partum fact sheet (.pdf) before your next doctor's visit.  Effects of MS on fertility There is no evidence that MS impairs fertility or leads to an increased number of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths or congenital malformations. Several studies of large numbers of women have repeatedly demonstrated that pregnancy, labor, delivery and the incidence of fetal complications are no different in women who have MS than in control groups without the disease.  Effects of pregnancy on MS Before 1950, most women with MS were counseled to avoid pregnancy because of the belief that it might make their MS worse. Over the past 40 years, many studies have been done in hundreds of women with MS, and they have almost all reached the opposite conclusion: that pregnancy reduces the number of MS relapses , especially in the second and third trimesters.  Effects in the postpartum period Relapse rates tend to rise in the first three to six months postpartum, and the risk of a relapse in the postpartum period is estimated to be 20-40%. These relapses do not appear to contribute to increased long-term disability. In the studies with long-term follow-up of women with MS who had children, no increased disability as a result of pregnancy was found. Pregnancy is known to be associated with an increase in a number of circulating proteins and other factors that are natural immunosuppressants. Additionally, levels of natural corticosteroids are higher in pregnant than nonpregnant women. These may be some of the reasons why women with MS tend to do well during pregnancy.  Use of corticosteroid medications Women who use corticosteroids (for example,  methylprednisolone or  prednisone ) for acute MS relapsess may continue to use them during pregnancy. The use of prednisone in a woman who is breastfeeding should be carefully monitored.  Special concerns for the pregnant patient with MS Women who have gait difficulties may find these get worse during late pregnancy as they become heavier and their center of gravity shifts. Increased use of assistive devices to walk or use of a wheelchair may be advisable at these times. Bladder and bowel problems, which occur in all pregnant women, may be aggravated in women with MS who have pre-existing urinary or bowel dysfunction. MS patients may also be more subject to fatigue. In general, pregnancy does not appear to affect the long-term clinical course of MS. Women who have MS and wish to have a family can usually do so successfully with the assistance of their neurologist and obstetrician.

"The following statement is from one of the present class action lawsuits: ""Many compounding pharmacies (for Avastin) use syringes that are intended to be used by diabetics for injection into the skin. In many cases, both the barrel and the needle of the syringe have been lubricated with silicone oil. Such lubrication may be suitable for skin injections, but not for eye injections.""

"Excuse me for reactivating this old thread of 2013. We are now at a cross road where there is progression at the Lung and Adrenal Gland after 8 months of Afatinib+cetuximab, as well as multiple brain mets that have been stable for sometimes, presumably credit to Afatinib. The plan is to move to Carboplatin+Alimta as Tagrisso is not available yet here. However, the concern is the control of brain mets that we think may be less likely to hold by chemo. Our Oncologist is suggesting to continue Afatinib at low dose while we get on chemo. I think this combination is not well studied and there is a warning of Pancytopenia by Dr. Christine Chung from John Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Centre. (http://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2015/04100/Warning_about_Chemotherapy_Afatinib_Combination.3.aspx), but another article seems to report some benefits and acceptable risk profile from the combination of Afatinib with Paclitaxel at Lux-Lung 5 trial.

"My wife just had her first scan post-initial 4 Opdivo rounds (2 weeks each) and it was not exactly what we hoped for, but again, hard to really know how good/bad it is since the oncologist said Opdivo often doesnâ€™t show effect for another 2 months. HoweverÃ¢Â€Åš.the main lung tumor in the right middle lung has grown a small bit, and there are now some new nodules.  Oncologist said they could be new metastases or they could be initial sites of inflammation from the Opdivo as it starts to work â€“ canâ€™t tell yet. There are also two new lesions in the liver.  The last two blood tests have shown increasing AST and ALT liver enzymes, but as yet all of the other blood chemistry, including bilirubin and ALP, is quite normal and there are no other blood (or physical) signs of liver malfunction.  So, the increased liver enzymes could be from the increased size/number of liver lesions/metastases, or could be due to the initial inflammation of the kidney lesions caused by the Opdivo.  Canâ€™t tell yet.  Unfortunately they canâ€™t do more of the Opdivo if the liver enzymes are too high, so if they are still high this week when the next round is to start they will have to wait a week to see if the enzymes go down.  If not, we switch to something else for the moment and could possibly come back to Opdivo (or one of the dual immune combos) in the future. Luckily no new lesions anywhere else, rest of lung is fine, other organs all look fine, nothing new in the bone.

"Hah! Other way round for me. It started with my colon, then about 10 years later moved onto my thyroid. Was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 2013. Levothyroxine appears to keep it well controlled, but I do sometimes get paranoid that my hormones are doing funky things anyway.  Canada Mark said... A year before mine really struck, I had symptoms of blood in stools (minor) and sporadic along with mucus for a few months. Very lose stool. No urgency though. I thought I had colon cancer or maybe a really bad stomach bug. I was afraid to go to the doctor for fear he would say I have cancer (I was only 23 at the time). Most people seem to have gone through previous symptoms before the disease struck for real and they got a diagnosis. But not me. Mine started out of the blue, and I'd not had a day of diarrhoea before then. No bleeding, mucus, urgency, or abdominal pain either. The only thing is I had chronic constipation as a child and teenager. But I sorted out the constipation in my late teens by simply eating green stuff for the first time in my life, and increasing my fibre intake. Had 5-6 years of perfect poops before the Crohn's started. Never had another normal poop after that; I'm not exaggerating. By the way, while I would never claim McDonald's is a healthy meal, I suspect it is slightly healthier in the UK than in the US - HFCS has never been a big thing in Europe and I was never a big soda drinker.

Thanks Janine and thanks for the bonus vid!    It took me 6 months to progress on Tarceva and never got to try Afatinib as Onc hadnâ€™t seen good results with other patients so after some chemo & a try at Nivo I tested positive for T790M & was put on Tagrisso.  My last scan showed complete metabolic remission though the primary is still visible on scans but at the back of my mind Iâ€™m very aware that the average time to resistance on Tagrisso is 10 months and Iâ€™m in my tenth month now! Obviously all patients are different but my choices going forward are limited due to chemo induced  kidney failure last year so I was just wondering what correlations if any had been done.

"Hello, I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic lung cancer in August, 2018. I had radiation treatment on my brain tumors that resulted in 1 tumor now barely detectable and the other 2 reduced by 75% â€“ I was also being treated with 2 chemos (alimta and cisplatin) as well as keytruda. After 4 treatments of this combo, I am now on ongoing maintenance and receiving only alimta and keytruda. I have no side affects with the exception of sensitive/weepy eyes and a drippy nose in week 3 of every treatment.

I had no idea that it may reduce the effectiveness of the keytruda so plan to speak to my chemo pharmacist this Friday when I go in for my next treatment. There is so much conflicting information on the web, we must all be careful. My oncologist says of there is not a study on it, she will not recommend it.

"A recent study of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients treated with fingolimod, natalizumab, or alemtuzumab found they were less likely to convert to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) compared to those being treated with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. The study , published in the journal JAMA, set out to determine the association between the use, the type of, and the timing of DMTs with the risk of conversion to SPMS. One thousand, five hundred and fifty-five RRMS patients from 21 countries took part in the study. The results revealed that patients initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta had a lower hazard of conversion (12%) to SPMS than matched untreated patients (27%). Initial treatment with fingolimod (Gilenya), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), or natalizumab (Tysabri) was associated with a lower risk of conversion (7%) than initial treatment with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (12%). The probability of conversion was lower when glatiramer acetate or interferon beta was started within five years of disease onset versus later. When glatiramer acetate or interferon beta were escalated to fingolimod, alemtuzumab, or natalizumab within five years versus later, the hazard ratio was 0.76. Currently interferon beta and glatiramer acetate are a first tier treatment for RRMS. Fingolimod is a second tier drug and alemtuzumab and natalizumab are part of the top tier of drugs neurologists can prescribe to patients. Depending on how active a patients MS is, their neurologist will suggest a drug to suit. Some of these lower tier drugs have only a 30% success rate in reducing relapses, whereas some of the higher tiered drugs, such as alemtuzumab has showed it can reduce relapses by 70% versus a placebo. Researchers concluded that these findings, considered along with these therapiesâ€™ risks, may help inform decisions about disease modifying therapy selection.",tysabri,2,,,

They state, that the position / allele ( cis or trans ) will impact how effective Tagrisso is likely to be as a single agent or in combination with the older TKIâ€™s. The newest generation of genetic testing might be able to tell you this, but as far as I know, this is not ( yet) done routinely. Please,   take all of this with a grain of salt, again Iâ€™m not a professional and donâ€™t  REALLY know what Iâ€™m talking about. Sorry for the  limited information. If I can find the paper again ,I will send you a link. thanks Kempten",tagrisso,2,,,
"Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung, a major subtype of non-small lung cancer (NSCLC), nowadays triggers mandatory testing of tumor tissue for alterations in four genes: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and more recently, BRAF. If present, these alterations predict sensitivity to specific targeted drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that work better and often longer than standard chemotherapy, and are better tolerated. However, there are many more targetable/actionable genomic alterations (also known as â€œdriversâ€) in NSCLC. This blog post will briefly discuss most of them, with the goal of promoting molecular testing for more than the four â€œusual suspectsâ€ mentioned above. Some patients with these alterations may benefit from FDA-approved drugs or from enrollment in clinical trials that are testing additional drugs and drug combinations. Molecular alterations in NSCLC for which there are FDA-approved treatment options EGFR: EGFR is mutated in 10% of Caucasian patients with NSCLC and in 25% of Asian patients. EGFR mutations are more frequent in non-smokers. Most mutations in EGFR are either deletions in a portion of the gene called exon 19, or a mutation known as L858R in exon 21; these two account for 90% of all EGFR mutations. Rare mutations are found in exons 18 or 20. There are four FDA-approved drugs that target EGFR mutations (erlotinib/Tarceva, geftinib/Iressa, afatinib/Gilotrif and osimertinib/Tagrisso), and more drugs are being investigated in clinical trials. Mutations in exon 18 respond better to afatinib than to erlotinib or gefitinib, while alterations in exon 20 may respond better to osimertinib, and likely to some drugs currently in trials (nazartinib/EGF816 and poziotinib). For a patient who receives EGFR-targeting drugs, it is almost inevitable that these medications will eventually stop working. When this happens, it is very important to conduct new mutational testing to determine the mechanism of resistance to these drugs. Testing can be performed on a biopsy of a resistant lesion or a liquid biopsy (via blood test). Several known molecular alterations lead to resistance, and while I will not go into details here, many of these can be addressed by using relevant targeted drugs. ALK: The gene ALK is involved in â€œchromosomal translocationâ€ in which it becomes fused with another gene, EML4. The frequency of EML4-ALK translocation is about 5% to 8% in NSCLC and is much higher in non-smokers, accounting for 22% of mutations found in non-smokers. Crizotinib (Xalkori) is the FDA-approved first-line treatment for tumors with ALK rearrangements. and ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib are used for treatment of ALK-positive cancers that develop resistance to prior treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Lorlatinib may be approved soon. ROS1: This gene is involved in translocations in about 1% to 2% of NSCLC cases. ROS1 is closely related to ALK, and crizotinib is the FDA-approved drug for this subtype. Other ALK-targeting drugs that are already approved for the ALK subtype (ceritinib and lorlatinib) have shown excellent activity in the ROS1 subtype as well. Entrectinib (RDX-101) and PF-02341066 are also in trials for ROS1-translocated NSCLC. BRAF: This mutation is found in 3% to 4% of NSCLC cases and is strongly associated with smoking history, unlike the three mutations above. V600E is the predominant type of BRAF mutation, and its presence in tumors is associated with a very high rate of response to the combination of dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist), which was approved by the FDA in June 2017. Molecular alterations in NSCLC for which drugs are available in clinical trials MET amplification: A high number of copies of the MET gene is found in 3% to 7% of newly diagnosed NSCLC cases. It is a more frequent alteration (21%) that drives resistance to EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant cancers. Drugs in trials for patients with amplified MET are crizotinib, cabozantinib, tivantinib, glesatinib (MGCD265), and INC280. MET exon 14 skipping: This particular form of MET alteration (METex14) results in production of a potentially overactive MET protein. It is encountered in 3% to 4% of NSCLC cases, more often in older patients, and is not particularly characteristic of non-smokers. Of interest, a different type of lung cancer, pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, harbors MET exon 14 skipping in 20% to 30% of cases. About 20% of METex14 cancers also contain a high number of copies of METex14. A number of drugs that might work against METex14-positive tumors are available through trial enrollment; these include crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, and merestinib. HER2: Mutations in this EGFR-related gene are found in 2% to 5% of cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung, more often in Asian patients, and mostly in non-smokers. The most common HER2 mutations are insertions in exon 20. The drugs dacomimitinb, neratinib, and pyrotinib are being tested in trials for HER2-positive NSCLC, and the EGFR-targeting drug afatinib could also be used for this subtype. RET: This gene is altered in 1% to 2% of NSCLC cases and tends to form paired rearrangements with one of at least five other gene â€œpartners.â€ A number of drugs, such as cabozantinib, vandetanib, alectinib, LOXO-292, BLU-667, and RXDX-105 are being tested against such tumors in clinical trials. NTRK: The frequency of gene fusions/translocations involving the NTRK gene is estimated to be anywhere between 0.1% and 3.3% in NSCLC cases that have no other identifiable mutations. Drugs that are relevant to treatment of this subtype are entrectinib (RXDX-101) and larotrectinib (LOXO-101), which are both available in trials and have already been shown to have very good activity, including in disease that has metastasized to the brain. There are also relevant trials with other investigational drugs, like DS-6051b, TSR-001, and more. Why and where to get testing? 29% to 45% of NSCLC patients may have targetable mutations, with EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 alterations accounting for only 16% to 20%. This provides a strong rationale for testing of multiple mutations in each patient, which is not yet mandated in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. However, the NCCN â€œstrongly advises broader molecular profiling with the goal of identifying rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available or to appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical trials.â€ Numerous providers offer mutational testing, and some of these tests are covered by health insurance plans, which should be discussed with the treating oncologist. Just recently, a possibility of getting free mutational testing for some cancer patients was announced . Fifty hospitals will be able to order testing from Strata Oncology, and while this test is not specific for NSCLC, it will cover many of the rare mutations. The Strata testing process will include matching patients to potentially relevant clinical trials. Remember: â€œBroad molecular profiling is a key component of the improvement of care of patients with NSCLC.â€ â€“NCCN guidelines",alectinib,2,,,
"I offered my own opinions from personal experience using Tecfidera as well as Gilenya and Lemtrada rather than comments that attack my advocacy of Lemtrada that defies the evidence. I donâ€™t assume that we MS patients have limited cognitive skills. Instead, I believe that we should not blindly accept the choices of others that may recommend treatments based on different priorities, chief among them is cost. My experience and best judgement is to be an informed advocate and do my own research from reputable sources such as the MS Society, MS Trust, MS Association of America, BARTS of London, and the JAMA Neurology, and published clinical trial results, among others. The Lemtrada clinical trial results that I referenced shows definitively that MOST trial participants (not just Orlando and a friend) had their disease progression halted or reversed during the five year clinical trial. The results are in a peer reviewed document submitted by the drug manufacturer to more than 40 national regulatory agencies before approvals were ultimately given around the globe. I think we are at a pivotal time in MS research where significant progress is being made and breakthrough solutions are changing the MS landscape and treatment paradigm. Todayâ€™s best practices involve early intervention with the most efficacious DMT instead of the older practice of treating patients with incrementally stronger DMTs beginning with less effective but safer DMTs in theory. I believe that it is our responsibility to stay informed and seek the care of MS specialists who stay current with the new innovations.",gilenya,2,,,
"A combination of radiotherapy with local and systemic immunotherapy may be clinically beneficial for treating some types of tumors. There is an urgent need, however, for the development of clinical trials to explore this novel treatment regimen, according to an article published in Trends in Cancer . Novel immunotherapies are entering clinical practice at an accelerating rate, but clinicians are not sure how to best combine them with radiotherapy. 1 â€œLocal tumor radiotherapy has shown the ability to enhance responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors, similar to ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and Toll-like receptor agonists, such as imiquimod. This includes other agents not yet approved, but under investigation for human use, in several pre-clinical models of cancer, including breast, colorectal, brain, melanoma, lung and prostate,â€ said lead study author Sandra Demaria, MD, professor of radiation oncology and pathology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, New York. She said that early data show a benefit with a combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapies in patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and some lymphoid malignancies. Dr Clinical trials are ongoing in other cancer types as well, and producing some rather encouraging results in preliminary reports. Responses were seen with the combination of radiation and anti-PD-1 in tumor types where responses to anti-PD-1 alone had not been significant in some patients with ovarian cancer and small intestinal adenocarcinoma. â€œAs of now, data suggest that the use of radiation in patients during immunotherapy appears to be generally safe and to benefit patients beyond local control of their tumor. Treating physicians should evaluate the patients for abscopal responses, but more data are needed before the combination treatment can be recommended as a standard of care,â€ Dr Demaria told Cancer Therapy Advisor . To use radiation with the purpose of generating anti-tumor immune responses, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms involved. Dr Demaria said there are many unanswered questions about whether greater immune responses are triggered by high- or low-dose radiation, given once or several times, and if different tumors respond differently to the varying fractionation regimens. â€œUnfortunately, in most clinical studies the radiation is given based on the physician preference or the standard of care used for palliation, which may not produce the desired effects,â€ said Dr Demaria. â€œWe need to do more work and think critically when designing clinical studies. This is a multidisciplinary topic and it should be based on a novel partnership among immunologists/immunotherapists and radiation oncologists.â€ According to Dr Demaria, this process is not unique to radiation. Other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies, are being used for patients receiving immunotherapy. Clinicians still don't know how these treatments interact. RELATED: New Drug Combination May Be Beneficial for Newly-diagnosed Myeloma Patients Raquibul Hannan, MD, PhD, assistant professor of radiation oncology at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern in Dallas, said the synergistic approach of radiation and immunotherapy is both promising and exciting. This applies particularly to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). â€œWe are calling the approach of strategically combining SABR and immunotherapy i-SABR, and we have 3 ongoing clinical trials, NCT01896271 and NCT01818986, which were designed to answer this question about which cancer sites and immunotherapies are responsive to this strategy,â€ Dr Hannan told Cancer Therapy Advisor . â€œMultiple new immunotherapies are changing the standards of care for melanoma, lung, head and neck, bladder and renal cancers.â€ The benefits, however, may not be limited only to those malignancies. Dr Hannan said that many more sites are being evaluated to determine those that are even minimally responsive to an immunotherapy/radiotherapy combination. â€œWherever there is response, there is a possibility of radiation therapy to boost that response. When there is no response, there is an opportunity for radiation to initiate a response. This is due to the fact that radiation initiates a tumor-specific response and the tumor specificity is lacking in the checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies,â€ said Dr Hannan. â€œIt is through clinical trials that we will identify which sites are more responsive to this i-SABR strategy. In my opinion, melanoma and RCC will be the first, but certainly not the only sites where this strategy will prove to be synergistic.â€ Reference 1. Demaria S, Coleman CN, Formenti SC.

"Two steps forward and one huge step back! Sorry for the length of time for an update, a lot has happened. My husband had his first treatment privately (Avastin injections) and noticed some improvement about a week afterwards. This was enough to get him up on his feet again, we started walking in the last week and he has been seeing family again. His depression was starting to lift. His BG levels are right down, off the insulin and he's only half a stone off a healthy BMI. We could only afford one round of treatment privately, so had to transfer to the NHS. We had our first appointment yesterday at the Consultant's clinic, but we were seen by a Dr not the consultant. It was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. Despite being warned about my husband's anxiety issues and fragile mental state, the DR was completely insensitive and quite aggressive in his approach. I realise they cannot sugar coat things, but there are tactful ways of discussing prognosis. Even though my husband has seen improvement after the first injection, the Dr seemed quite dismissive that we would see much more improvement. My understanding is that there are no guarantees, but even Consultants cannot predict who will repond effectively to treatment? This came as a crushing blow to my husband, who has retreated to bed and does not want to talk. The diagnosis is non-proliferative retinopathy in the left eye, severe proliferative retinopathy in the right. Severe maculopathy in both eyes, but with the right (the impaired eye then worst). The treatment plan is Eylea injections in both, laser just in the right to begin with. I intend to speak with PALS on Monday and see if there is anyway we can see a more sympathetic clinician next time. I honestly don't think my husband could go through that again and it will be a struggle to get him there. I just wish we could afford to go through the whole thing privately. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",eylea,2,,,

Reply posted for hans409. You've had more than one flare that sent you to the ER. the mesalamine's are or maintenance but you still need a preventative medicine. Generally that is either 6MP or Imuran as a first line. Then they move to biologics like Humira or Remicade. It sounded like Imuran didn't work for you so these two meds shouldn't be seen as overkill at all. I can see maybe trying 6MP as a next step but my understanding is Imuran is a derivative and not likely to be that much different. Good luck one way or the other.,humira,0,,,
"Itâ€™s been a little more than two full years since I was officially diagnosed with multiple sclerosis on December 1, 2015. The contents of this entire blog are a summation of my struggle to accept or even understand what that information actually meant for me and serve as a kind of proof that this crazy shit is actually really happening. Letâ€™s face it. These have been two rather shitty years. I got my diagnosis. I began to go downhill. It made me wonder if the mere function of knowing somehow made my body kick into disability mode. Like ignorance was my friend, and now that I was enlightened, my body was throwing a disease party and my entire central nervous system was invited. Limbs were useless. Fatigue made me a living zombie. I learned, for the first time in my life, what real anxiety feels like. I changed into a completely different person almost over night. I stopped recognizing myself when I looked in the mirror. I stopped going out at night almost entirely. It was just all too hard. All of it. All of the life I had before December 1, 2015 became too fucking hard. You guys already know all of that, but itâ€™s important to understand the mental affects this disease unleashed on me to understand why these last few weeks have felt so downright amazing. Formerly outgoing, see-and-be-seen Beth, the girl who could handle anything turned into home-bound, never-want-to-be-seen Beth who lived in mortal fear of somehow not being able to think let alone walk. Sometimes this was a physical thing. Most of the time if was a physical thing but Iâ€™d been ignoring the entire mental side of what was happening. I tried and failed to look at the bright side. I swung back and forth between dire despair and insane denial. Cheryl, my therapist, and me just keep reassuring each other that we just had to believe it would get better. We just had to. Then the pain started. I was just getting back on my feet after the Great Relapse of Summer 2017 (I call it that in my mind, like a title of a movie), when I was trying to get back into some kind of routine with my life. Getting myself to the office at least a few days a week. Trying to function. Trying to try harder. In the middle of all of that, I started to feel this intense fire in my body. Iâ€™d never felt anything like it before. I think I have a fairly high tolerance for pain, but this was something different. I would feel it creeping up my spine around 3PM while I was sitting at my desk. I would begin to feel desperate knowing where it was heading. I knew I could rely on Sandy, my BFF who also happens to work with me, to help me get to my car but then I had to get in my house, do my daily cat chores. Get myself to bed. The mere physical effort it took to get me out of my house and to another location rendered me basically useless because my body was riddled with fire. I got a fancy new ergonomic chair! Itâ€™s amazingly comfortable but it didnâ€™t help with this newfound pain. Iâ€™d drag myself home. Drag myself up and down and down and up a bunch of stairs. Iâ€™d lay in bed in tears, my entire body on fire from the base of my skull to the bottoms of my feet to my fingertips. I was eating 800mg of Ibruprofen every four hours or so (way too much). It didnâ€™t help me even a little bit. Iâ€™d start to think about how the next day was likely going to be more of the same. It was becoming pretty consistent. Sometimes I woke up in the morning with the pain already in full force. I was starting to feel desperate. If living any kind of â€œnormalâ€ life led to this kind of pain, I was beginning to panic. How could I do this? I do pretty well acting normal in the real world, but Iâ€™m not that great of a pretender! I was toying with the idea of asking The Great Scott if there was something I could take for pain. The minute that thought crossed my mind I shuddered. NO MORE DRUGS. Those words echoed in my head. I cannot take a single additional prescription medication. I mean, there has to be some point of diminishing returns, right? I take so, so many meds. Iâ€™d list them here but youâ€™d probably have a hard time believing it. Also, pain medication just scares me. Iâ€™m definitely the type of person who would be inclined to abuse medication like that. If one pill helps, I bet two pills help so much more! I just know myself. Itâ€™s not a good idea. I started to feel pretty dark. I think you could probably tell from the posts throughout 2017. I tried to keep my humor about me. I always reminded myself that there are people who have it so much worse than I do. That I should be grateful every minute of every day. Thinking those very true things didnâ€™t really help much. Knowing other people are suffering doesnâ€™t make your pain go away when your pain is a physical, menacing presence like a fire burning inside your skin that nobody can see but it feels like it might consume you. It just doesnâ€™t help. Friends Iâ€™d made online suggested to me that I consider trying cannabis for my pain. I mean, Iâ€™ve read and researched a ton about this possibility and I truly believed it had merit. I already used some homemade cannabis edibles to help me sleep at night (I will never reveal where I get them but suffice to say, the person who makes them for me is a literal angel on earth). Then thereâ€™s that one small detail I couldnâ€™t get around. Cannabis isnâ€™t legal here in Pennsylvania. I know weâ€™re in the process of legalizing medical cannabis but thatâ€™s a process that takes a lot of time. Iâ€™d heard a bit about how hard it was to not only get the card you need to become a patient but then to get supplies from a very limited number of dispensaries. Oh. Also, as you might suspect, The Great Scott (my MS specialist) is 100% against medical MMJ across the board. Shocker. But there is more to this struggle than those very factual, legal hurdles. There is the fact, proven over 50+ years of life, that I freaking hate weed. I hate how it makes me feel. I hate how it smells. I hate smoking anything (except for that very short spurt with menthol ultra lights in my thirties when I was drinking my face off five nights a weekâ€¦that was fun). I found weed basically repellent. It had a terrible effect on me. It used to be a thing between my husband and I, when he was alive, because he smoked pot every day of his life. He knew I hated it but not because of any ethical or moral reason but simply for the fact that as soon as he took one hit of a joint he instantly became repellent to me. I can remember telling him, â€œYou know, they call that shit dope for a reason. Gross.â€ And he would laugh and laugh. But I digress. Suffice to say, me and marijuana are not friends. I couldnâ€™t really see it becoming a fundamental part of my life. I watched how much it was helping some of my MSâ€™er friends. Meg, in particular, inspired me. Watching her joyful face as she chronicled her daily walks on Instagram â€“ noting that this new found joy for walking had been something she feared she lost forever! But not anymore. Meg credits cannabis with giving her her life back. You should read Megâ€™s blog. She knows so much more about medical MMJ and MS than I could ever share here. Check it out. But the smile on Megâ€™s face was making me really happy and haunting me all at the same time. I wanted to smile again. I wanted to smile again without the smile feeling like an internal grimace. I remember telling some of my MS friends, â€œI wish I could get the benefit of the relief without the high! Iâ€™d do that in an instant.â€ Um. Guess what? You totally can! Weâ€™ll stop here and Iâ€™ll admit that Iâ€™m not entirely comfortable writing about this. I havenâ€™t told many non-MS friends about this. It makes me feel funny â€“ even though Iâ€™m doing something completely legal and non-psychoactive, it still bothers me. I havenâ€™t broken this news to my mom or members of my family. Iâ€™ve told my closest friends, the ones I trust the most, but Iâ€™m not sure why this feels like such a dirty little secret. Iâ€™ve been using CBD to relieve my pain and itâ€™s hard for me to admit this in writing but itâ€™s starting to really change me in all the very best ways. I started this whole exploration looking for relief from the pain and I indeed found that relief. But I got a lot more too. Letâ€™s start at the beginning. I started with CBD oil from CW Hemp in Colorado. I had seen a story about these guys on CBS Sunday Morning years ago. Hereâ€™s a link to an excerpt from a CNN documentary that tells the story of Charlotte . This kid was having 300 seizures a week. The story is heartbreaking but it had a very interesting and happy ending. The CBD oil made by the Stanley Brothers in Colorado changed Charlotteâ€™s life (hence the name of their company in her honor). It was worth squirting some pricey, nasty tasting oil under my tongue a few times a day to see if it could help my pain. AND IT DID. It took a while to come over me, but about a half hour after taking the oil, I felt the pain get quiet. It didnâ€™t disappear immediately, but it got better. I started with their â€œeverydayâ€ product but it wasnâ€™t strong enough for me. I progressed quickly to â€œeveryday advancedâ€ and that was much better. Better was enough for me to dive into more research. I discovered that for my kind of pain, the degree and severity, ingesting CBD oil is not the most effective way to get the Cannabidiol into your blood stream. By the time the oil is ingested and processed in your digestive system, through your liver etc. itâ€™s down to something like 15% CBD. Iâ€™m fudging numbers here a bit but the reduction in concentration was distinct. I had to find another way to get the cannabidiols into my system without using the oil as the mechanism so the cannabidiol concentration would be higher. This led me to another (100% legal) product called CBD shatter. Shatter is crumbly. A clear solid that breaks up into little pieces. To get the CBD into your blood stream most directly, I had to get a vape pen to use with it. Here was another hurdle! I know I had that short stint as a smoker in my thirties but it sucked. Literally. I hate smoking anything. I know Iâ€™m vaping (not technically smoking) but it feels essentially the same to me. I inhale vapor that comes from heating the CBD shatter in my vape pen. It looks very much like â€œdabbingâ€ weed concentrates â€“ but this is devoid of THC so thereâ€™s no psychotropic effect. I had been really skeptical about that so when it turned out not to get me high, I was super relieved. I found another form of even more highly concentrated CBD in the form of a wax. Hereâ€™s the thingâ€¦I will share info with anyone that wants it in messages or emails, but I donâ€™t want to do that here. Iâ€™m obviously not a doctor nor an expert on anything related to CBD vaping. But I am here to tell you that Iâ€™ve felt happy for the first time in a months these past few weeks. I havenâ€™t thought about taking a pain medication of any kind in over a month. I was buying Advil liqui-gels in bulk! Not anymore. There was an even better after-effect of my new practice. That constant churn in my head. The fear that nothing will ever be the same. The constant â€œwhat ifsâ€ that fly around my head quite literally 24 hours a day, even finding their way into my dreams. The ever present and sometimes crippling anxiety about what my future could holdâ€¦itâ€™s quiet. Itâ€™s so very quiet. That anxiety voice is still there, I know it is. It will probably never go away completely. I mean, when you have a disease that is chronic and degenerative thatâ€™s kind of the deal. Especially one as unpredictable as MS where literally things can change from day-to-day, even minute-to-minute. Having that yoke hanging around your very unstylish neck is a difficult business. Things that make that voice quiet have eluded me completely. And Iâ€™m a therapy expert! Ask Cheryl. CBD vaping is helping me. Itâ€™s helping me a lot. I hate doing it. It still feels wrong to me even though I know itâ€™s not. I hate how it tastes (some people actually love it! Go figure.). But Iâ€™m doing it three to four times a day to help me maintain my calm, quiet mind. To help me keep the fire in my body at bay. Even to help me loosen up these ridiculously spastic muscles that prevent me from moving around in a more natural way. It helpsâ€¦nearly everything. So there you have it. My dirty little secret. Itâ€™s really not dirty at all! I wish I knew why Iâ€™m so judgey! Mostly of myself. Maybe Cheryl will cure me of that some day but until then, Iâ€™m just trying to learn to accept things as they are. And yes, I will be discussing this entire development with The Great Scott and I am already steeling myself for the medical debate that will surely ensue. But hereâ€™s the thing. Iâ€™m on the mac daddy of MS drugs right now (Ocrevus). Itâ€™s not been the life changing experience I had been told it would be. Itâ€™s been justâ€¦meh. If something else helps me want to open my eyes every day, maybe leave the house a bit more, embrace the damn cane (sorry Stanley) and perhaps shower a little more often? Iâ€™m down with that. In all of my research I can find very little down side to vaping CBD. Iâ€™ve experienced exactly zero side effects. None. It might not work forever. So Iâ€™m going to enjoy it while it lasts. Iâ€™m going to deal with the fact that I canâ€™t really carry it around with me â€“ it might be legal but it doesnâ€™t LOOK legal â€“ so I can only be pain free for several hour intervals but hell, thatâ€™s more than I had before! Iâ€™ll take it. I feel like that little tree, up there in the picture, a lot of the time. I try to keep things light and airy but I donâ€™t often feel light or airy. I make the jokes and brush off the badness. But I feel dark and alone so much more of the time (even while surrounded by people who love me, both near and far). A little ray of light seeping in is most welcome! Even if I have to suck it in through my lungs. Iâ€™d eat rocks right now if someone told me theyâ€™d make me feel better. You can bet on that.",ocrevus,1,,,
"10 September 2018 - Roche faces a fresh row over drug pricing in Britain, following a decision by the body responsible for medicine use within the state health service not to approve its drug Ocrevus for treating a highly disabling form of multiple sclerosis.

"I will let neuros response about private prescription In India only 2% of people affected with MS have access to any MS drug. However by prescribing-off label neurologists maybe frightened that pharma will not look favourably on them and importanly they like to follow prescribing patterns set by licenced drugs as the licencing gives them comfort that they are adhereing to best practise. It is interesting that Iran manufactures drugs that are licenced such that they make their own beta interferons, and apparently I have heard I I have no concrete proof so treat it as hearsay) that they make DMF and fingolimod. So this is against the patents. What are people going to do to them ""embargo them? :-)"". Maybe the embargos imposed created this culture however I believe they have not made movectro or should I say stopped their manufacturing programme because it is not licenced. So the licencing of generic cladribine in one country would help others. In the quest for the white knights it was the intention to obtain such a licence such that people who have the comfort that they are folowing accepted proceedure and this may give them some protection against being sued if anything goes wrong. However, throughout our attempts, it was amazing that all the people in power to help us along the path never wanted this mentioned in any correspondence and never saw it more than an academic exercise. Anyway lets see what happens if Movectro gets a lisence as will be seen in tomorrows post comparing the oral verses non-oral route.",fingolimod,2,,,
"I have recently been diagnosed with MS. First MS attack was probably 2007 at this time I had an MRI which revealed one lesion. I had a follow up MRI 6 months later which showed no changes so I was told nothing was wrong. Over the years I have has similar attacks with mainly loss of sensation in my legs. Over the past year or so they have been happening closer together and seem to be much worse in duration and intensity. I had an MRI in February which has revealed an extensive amount of lesions. My first appointment with my neurologist was 10/03/2016. At this appointment he said it was highly likely I had an MS and he would want to be very aggressive with the treatment as it appeared to be quite advanced. He does not feel as though it is necessary to complete a Lumbar Puncture as everything indicates MS to this point. He took a lot of blood, gave me a very intense course of steroids (1000mg of prednisolone for 3 days) and asked me to return on 21/04/2016 and I actually left this appointment quite upset. He confirmed it was MS. My JCV results had not come back so we could not discuss those but he really didnâ€™t cover anything. He didnâ€™t mention the type of MS but I am assuming RRMS. He did not mention if I had active lesions which you all seem to talk aboutâ€¦ Whatâ€™s the difference? Does it matter that I donâ€™t know? My current symptoms are pain all over (nerve pain), it constantly feels like things are crawling on me, I have horrible fatigue, my legs are weak, tingly and numb and walking is really difficult, the headaches are horrible. He has pretty much said since the steroids did not work there is nothing I can do about any of this?!?! Is this really the case? He briefed me on several medications and once he had done that pretty much said none of these are any good for me because they arenâ€™t strong enough and I have the choice of Gilenya, Tysabri and Lemtrada. I have decided I donâ€™t want the Gilenya option. I started to ask questions about these options when he told me he had another patient and I would have to come back in three weeks. He seemed to be leaning to Tysabri but couldnâ€™t really tell me why. He did mention ONE other drug Ocrelizumab which has not been approved yet but is expected to be released in the coming months. He seemed to want me to be put on Tysabri and then possibly switch to this one but could not tell me anything about the new drug as the study has not been released yet so he canâ€™t discuss it. Iâ€™m now more confused then I have been and am concerned that I need â€œaggressive treatmentâ€ but that he is willing to continue pushing my appointments back and back. I am leaning to Lemtrada and it appears to have a period of 6 weeks once you DECIDE to have it before treatment can begin so even if I choose at my next appointment to have it thatâ€™s 9 weeks before I can actually START treatment. Does anyone have any recommendations or ideas about these two drugs? How do you even decide something like this?",ocrelizumab,2,,,

"The purpose of this study  https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/clini ... als/15-048 is to assess the safety of combining two drugs, varlilumab and nivolumab, in patients with advanced solid tumors that have continued to grow despite treatment. Varlilumab is an investigational drug that binds to a protein on immune cells called CD27, which makes the immune system stronger. Nivolumab is a form of immunotherapy. It works by attaching to and blocking a molecule called PD-1, which shuts down the immune response. It is hoped that by binding to these proteins, this drug combination can activate the immune system and enhance the bodyâ€™s ability to detect and destroy cancer cells.",nivolumab,2,,,

"Tonometry: A test that measures pressure in the eye, called intraocular pressure. Your doctor uses it to check for glaucoma . Slit lamp examination: A physician or optometrist shines a vertical slit of light across your eye while looking through a microscope. It can help find many eye problems . Fundoscopic exam: The doctor gives you special eye drops to widen your pupil (he'll call this dilation). Then he shines a bright light into the back of the eye so he can see your retina. Refraction: If you have a vision problem, the doctor will place a series of lenses in front of each eye, one at a time, to figure out your prescription for corrective lenses. Visual acuity test: Youâ€™ll read a series of ever-smaller letters from across the room. This helps the doctor spot distance vision problems. Reading up-close can help him find problems with near vision. Fluorescein angiography: The doctor injects a fluorescent dye into a vein to take a series of retinal images. Regular adult eye exam : This collection of tests may include the ones mentioned above plus others, like eye movement.  Eye Treatments Contact lenses and glasses: They correct common eye problems like nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. LASIK (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis): A doctor creates a thin flap in your cornea. He then uses a laser to reshape it. This procedure improves nearsightedness, excessive farsightedness, and astigmatism . Radial keratotomy (RK): The doctor makes a series of small incisions in your cornea to reshape it. Once a common treatment for nearsightedness, itâ€™s rarely used today. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): The doctor rubs surface cells off your cornea, then uses a laser to improve nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. The cells grow back and your eye heals the same way it would if you'd scratched it. LASEK (laser epithelial keratomileusis): Itâ€™s similar to PRK. The doctor peels back the upper layer of cornea cells and uses a later to reshape it. He may replace or remove the flap afterward. Artificial tears : These eye drops are a lot like your natural tears. They can help treat dry or irritated eyes. Cyclosporine eye drops ( Restasis ): This anti-inflammatory eye drop can treat dry eye caused by inflammation. Laser photocoagulation: A doctor uses a laser on parts of the retina with poor circulation or to treat abnormal blood vessels directly. Itâ€™s often used for diabetic retinopathy but can also seal a retinal tear. Cataract surgery: The doctor removes the cloudy cataract and replaces your natural lens with a man-made version.",laser photocoagulation,2,,,

"For Helly - I realised I only answered half your question. Do I think that Cladribine might be a cure? For some people, maybe. In the sense that Cladribine seems to stop deterioration for something like half the people who have it, and some of these see improvement as well. I think Cladribine (and Lemtrada) are both a lot cheaper than the drugs that you have to take for the rest of your life. And they're more effective. Do the drug companies want to close down the huge market for Tecifidera, Tysabri, Gilenya etc etc? Probably not. I think Cladribine is a better drug than Lemtrada (same effectiveness, less side effects) and Cladribine may be too good for the drug companies to want it out there.",gilenya,2,,,

"A drug that failed to effectively strike larger targets in lung cancer hits a bulls-eye on the smaller target presented by a previously untreatable form of the disease, researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center report in Nature Medicine . Their research provided the scientific underpinning for clinical trials under way of the drug poziotinib against non-small-cell lung cancer that has a specific alteration called an exon 20 insertion in either the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). â€œThereâ€™s no effective treatment for these patients, so weâ€™re encouraged by early clinical trial results that show 7 of 11 patients (64 percent) with EGFR exon 20 mutations have confirmed tumor shrinkage after poziotinib treatment,â€ says John Heymach , M.D., professor and chair of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology . â€œWe need to see if these unprecedented response rates are maintained through the remainder of the trial, but our scientific findings provide a basis for optimism.â€ So far, 47 patients have enrolled in MD Andersonâ€™s original phase II trial for EGFR and 12 are enrolled in the HER2 arm. The drugâ€™s owner, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, has opened a multi-center phase II trial. Approved targeted therapies against EGFR mutations, which improve progression-free survival (PFS) and quality of life for other patients, have only seen response rates ranging from 3 to 12 percent among patients with the exon 20 insertion. Median PFS for these patients has been just two months. So far in the MD Anderson clinical trial, median PFS has not been reached after 6.6 months. About 3 percent of patients with either EGFR or HER2 disease have the exon 20 insertion, amounting to about 7,000 people diagnosed annually in the United States. Heymach also notes most patients with exon 20 insertions never have smoked. â€˜Deep diveâ€™ into exon 20 Heymachâ€™s team started to focus on exon 20 as part of its drug repurposing pipeline opened under MD Andersonâ€™s Moon Shots Programâ„¢ , a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into life-saving advances. â€œThe week we were identifying problems to focus upon in our Lung Moon Shotâ„¢ , I had three or four exon 20 patients and nothing to offer them at that point,â€ Heymach said. â€œIt was the clinic telling us where we were most needed. We decided to do a deep dive into exon 20.â€ Postdoctoral fellow Jacqulyne Robichaux, Ph.D., and colleagues tested 10 different targeted therapies against lung cancer cell lines with exon 20 insertions in EGFR or HER2 and found that the cells were strongly resistant to the drugs. Working with Shuxing Zhang, PHARMD, Ph.D., associate professor of Experimental Therapeutics, the team conducted 3D modeling of known crystal structures of EGFR and HER2. They found exon 20 insertions have â€œa dramatic effectâ€ on both proteinsâ€™ binding pockets â€“ where drugs connect to block activity. These smaller, misshapen pockets pose a barrier for other targeted therapies but also suggested structural characteristics that might make a drug effective. Smaller is better Robichaux says the team hypothesized that smaller EGFR inhibitors that have high levels of halogenation â€“ the presence of a group of molecules that help bind drugs to target receptors â€“ might have greater activity against exon 20 disease. This drew them to poziotinib, an EGFR inhibitor that had failed against the more common EGFR mutations in clinical trials. â€œThe structure of poziotinib had been published and showed that it was both small and highly halogenated, so we tested it against our panel of cells,â€ Robichaux said. Resistance tests showed poziotinib to be up to 100 times more potent against the cells than other drugs. They compared the specificity of poziotinib and three other targeted therapies against both exon20 mutations and the more common target, T790, hit by the other drugs. Exon 20 mutations were 65 times more sensitive to poziotinib while they resisted the other three drugs. Structural analysis showed poziotinibâ€™s size and flexibility allowed it to fit deeply into the exon 20 binding pocket, while the larger drugs either didnâ€™t fit at all or lacked the structure for deep connection. Tumors shrink in mouse models The team tested the drug in mouse models of exon 20 disease compared to afatinib, a second-generation targeted therapy that had shown some ability to inhibit the disease in cell lines. EGFR mice treated with poziotinib had an 80 percent reduction in disease burden as measured by MRI, while those treated with afatinib had a 35 percent increase to levels almost equal to untreated controls. HER2 exon 20 mice had a 60 percent reduction in tumor burden, compared to a 37 percent reduction by afatinib in a separate study. In both EGFR and HER2, poziotinib responses were durable at 12 weeks. The team tested poziotinib in mice with EGFR tumors developed from a patient. Poziotinib-treated mice had their tumor burden reduced by half, while those treated with afatinib had no reduction. In a second study of mice with another patient-derived EGFR exon 20 tumor, poziotinib reduced tumors by 85 percent or more in eight of nine mice over 14 days. Possible application to other cancers Heymachâ€™s team contacted Spectrum Pharmaceuticals about their findings. The company and Heymachâ€™s group cooperated to provide poziotinib to a few patients on a compassionate use basis while preparing to launch the MD Anderson clinical trial. Updated clinical trial results will be reported in detail later. Heymach, Robichaux and colleagues study resistance mechanisms to poziotinib to develop ways to overcome resistance. â€œEGFR/HER2 exon 20 insertions occur in cancers other than lung cancer,â€ Robichaux said. â€œIâ€™m investigating whether these other types also might be sensitive to poziotinib.â€ MD Anderson is developing intellectual property related to the use of poziotinib for the treatment of exon 20 insertion cancers.

"I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer in July 2015. Was put on Afatinb until July 2016 but drug resistance appeared in Apr 2016. Did 15 x RT to 2 nodules in May 2016 in the hope to be with Afatinib for as long as posible but unfortunately pleural effusion started to increase since end of June 2016. Stopped Afatinib on 27-7-2016 and was put on chemo (Carboplatin + Alimta) on 27-7-2016 & 18-8-2016. On 3 Sep 2016, Tagrisso was given to me free of charge under a compassionate scheme so I Chemo was quit even though it worked for me. CEA has dropped from 24 on 2 Sep to 6 on 14 Oct. On 3-6 Sep 2016, 2.3L of pleural effusion (PE) was drained out but the X-ray showed that my lung could not re-expand to the original position. My Onc asked me to try practice breathing exercises at home but another X-ray today showed that this didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help. The empty space is now occupied by fluid. The problem with this PE is that it has caused me coughing for 3 months and my Onc told me to live with it for the rest of my life!! He said as far as he was aware, there is no treatment method to re-expand the lung. Consulted a lung specilist in early Oct. He was of the opiniÃƒÂ³n that the trapped lung was due to the tumors that had entangled the lung membrane. He asked me to be patient and wait until the effectiveness of Tagrisso to penÃƒÂ©trate. By then, the lung will re-expand. On 21-24 Oct 2016, 2.7L of pleural effusion (PE) was drained out. No sign of re-expansiÃƒÂ³n was found. In fact, the situation has deteriorated. Now I need to use oxygen concentrator at home. I am most grateful to have your advice how this problem is overcome. Many thanks in advance!",alimta,2,,,
